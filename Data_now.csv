10,"Room wasn't ready when promised. System didn't send a receipt as promised. When I called and asked for a receipt, I was sent an unreadable file. When I complained, no one cared. Horrible customer service"
50,"Location of the hotel was excellent an within several ways of transportation. The Trolley stop is across street and you can ride it all day for $3.00 per person. Hotel was beautiful and clean..Fulton Street right outside the hotel I believe most establishments are owned by Harrahs, restaurants and bars with a great outside place to sit for dinner or have coffee/drinks at night. Casino is located on Fulton Street along with the garage elevators. The only thing I wish the hotel had would be a pool! Casino has many offerings for food and drinks. We had comp rooms, so not sure how much the hotel is. I didn't like how the Diamond club works now, however it really didn't affect us as we wanted to experience the culture and food in NOLA. Restaurants were within walking area, or…"
50,"Very nice property. The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and clean. The service in the whole hotel was impeccable. I dined at Ruth Chris while I was there and it was amazing. I definitely will visit this property in the future."
50,"The front desk staff at the hotel are so friendly and helpful, concierge staff were very helpful in getting discount coupons for area tours and information. Food, food, food, what ever you wish to eat, it is available...from Nathans Hot dogs to steaks and seafood. The Thanksgiving buffet was delicious and a great variety from the traditional (smoked and baked turkey) to oysters and shrimp ( fried and peel and eat). Again, I can not say enough good things about the staff...from the valet parking, slot attendants, and casino hostess."
50,"Lovely spacious room on the 25th Floor with a beautiful view of the Mississippi River. The hotel is in a prime location within walking distance to the River Walk shopping area, Aquarium of the Americas and other interests. Located on the streetcar line for easy transportation. The hotel meets all your needs for dining, from a large buffet to quick snacks, deli , upscale steakhouse and Starbucks coffee (and more)! The casino has a large variety of slot machines and table games with a upbeat vibe. I always choose Harrah's for a great New Orleans fun time! And most of all the staff is superior!!"
30,"the room was great. love going to New Orleans we go about every other month. like going to the casino. it is always a great time, the bars ,partys ,and the different people. It is a short trip about two hours from where we live"
50,"As always we had a wonderful time. The Hotel is state of the art, the employees are friendly and knowledgeable. The Hotel is in close proximity to the French quarter & other sites, exhibits & restaurants."
10,Book online they will tell u there sold out if u walk in asking for room and will not direct to another source. Management would not come out to speak and didn't care to even tell me to check online for rooms.
50,"It was a trip of ""Get Away!"" Took a stroll to ""Mothers"" for breakfast; enjoyed the sites of NO! The weather was perfect!!!!!!! The hotel was beautiful and preparing for Christmas as they were putting the Gingerbread House, etc."
30,people at hotel are amazing friendly and will help you as fast as they can. Property is nice only issue was beds were terrible and need to be replaced very clos to local restaraunts and attractions like the WWII museum
30,"I generally love my experience at Harrah's, and get there at least once or twice a year. This last trip was very subpar, though. Had a poor room (uncomfortable, no desk or area to really sit other than beds, weird hallway, lighting not all working), and a terrible lack of winning at all in the casino... it just seems seedier and less well-kept. Maybe just hitting them at a bad time."
40,"The room exceeded our expectations. The staff was friendly and very helpful! My husband and I traveled for a weekend getaway and we enjooyed the comfort of the room, the ease of walking out of our hotel to the casino and restaurants."
50,"An all around fun place to party, gamble, relax and be entertained! Rooms are beautifully decorated and beds are nothing short of AMAZING! I would say 99% of the staff will make anyone, including LGBTQ, like myself, guests feel welcomed and comfortable!"
50,"what a place to visit, the facilities and people are great. While I was there there were many places to go and things to see. There are a great deal of sites to visit and a lot of history to take in. Great for people of all ages."
30,"our room was ok. toilet was loose- worried it was going to fall over.The room was kind of old looking. It did have a nice view from the 19th floor. lobby was pretty. casino was loaded with penny machines. wanted to play dollar machines. people in slot services were nice. there were good things, but a lot of negative. go to Maddings if you get a chance. it was great and we could use comps there 1:1. the riverwalk is nearby, and that is nice! Short walk to the French Quarter- although this trip we didn't go- just gambled, as best we could! lots to see in the city and this is a good place to stay to visit & explore."
50,This was our first time staying at Harrahs New Orleans. We had to stay at the Hilton Riverside next door for 2 nights due to Harrahs had no rooms available. The room at the Hilton was clean but not worth the $300 a night we compared it to a plain comfort inn room. When we checked into Harrahs when we both walked in the room we said this is a Anniversary Room! Much nicer and 1/2 of cost of the Hilton! It’s a Great location and comfortable beds! We highly recommend and also going to Harrahs Steak house and asking for Ruby for your waitress and A Must to go to K Paul Restaurant Awesome food and and a must ask for Shiela as your Waitress they both made our experience Awesome along with the best food we ever ate!
50,"New Orleans Harrahs is a great place to stay,Rooms are large,clean and very comfortable.Thestaff is very friendly and always welcoming.The location is close to all attractions and the casino is fun and exciting."
40,If you’re looking for a hassle free good time without the drama and attitudes check out Harrahs in N.O. The staff is helpful and friendly. Be sure to check out the buffet as well. I went with family and had a great time!
40,Like a mini Vegas. Still some room for improvements but definitely a must see and hangout for a while. Great games and friendly Staff. Wish there were more areas inside to eat though. But the buffet was pretty good.
50,Excellent service and friendly employees. The room was lovely and very clean. Room service was yummy. Might need another chair and different pillows. Was within walking distance of several attractions and never a waif for a taxi.
40,"Harrahs is an excellent place to add to the excitement of the French Quarter. After you spend all your money at the bars, come here and build up the nest egg for the next trip down Bourbon St. The rooms and the amenities are exceptional."
40,I title my trip to Harrah’s as goof. I like the fact that I have the option of ordering my drink from my machine in stead of a hope and a prayer that someone will come by to take my order. The 24/7 is convenient for all. It location is close to the interstate.
20,"Traveled in group of 3 couples-2 couples on Floor 9, 1 couple of Floor 20-staying 4 nights. All 3 couples left rooms at 8 AM following our first night and returned at 4 PM - None of the rooms had been attended to by housekeeping. Couldn't take a shower after a day of touring the city as there were no clean towels. The two couples on floor 9 complained at the front desk and they sent housekeeping - the couple on floor 20 did not go to front desk and their room was never attended to that day-They complained to the front desk the following morning. Following days were no better- apparently the housekeeping staff carries a grudge when you ask them to do their job. Following 3 days as 3 rooms experienced minimal service-they did pick up dirty towels and literally tossed clean…"
50,"Employees were top rate from the valet to the check in host to the concierge! Pillows extra comfy and pillow top bed was terrific. Keep up the great work! Casino host, Kelvin Brown was exceptional! Casino was up to date with new games."

40,Nice room. Bar and food good Very crowded with football games Temperature was a little hot in the rooms otherwise I food experience. Need a better on floor food and drink Thanks again for a nice trip. All In all good place to stay
50,"The hotel is top of the line, but there is a fee for parking unless you're diamond or seven stars. The hotel room is decent size and they have a nice size tub separate from the shower. Hotel is quite busy and they usally have plenty of staff on duty.Very good Steak house located in the hotel, but not connected to Harrahs for points."
50,Love the atmosphere and great times we always have in New Orleans .Even if we didn't win any money we had a GREAT time. The hotel rooms are very luxurious with comfy beds...... and roomy when you have another couple in the room with you.
50,The room and the casino blew my mind. I was so impressed with the layout of the hotel and how elegant the room was I didn't want to leave. Then I went to the casino and was blow away by the layout and games there. The employees were amazing from the hotel to the casino. I didn't want to leave but believe I will be back and I will be telling everyone about my experience.
50,"Stayed at Harrahs hotel. Great hotel, connected to the casino. There are great places to drink and eat within walking distance of the hotel. Hotel right next to River Walk with some great shoping and places to eat. Good times!"
50,Thanks Harrahs for honoring comps even for one of New Orleans busiest weekends.My trip was awesome..Hilton Riverside was great.Great location to Casino and Mannings.Falcons party at Mannings was great...GoFalcons
50,Harrahs is a great place to go and gamble at but make sure you stop by at the reward center and get a reward card because the things Harrahs give away from you gambling with them is just amazing even if you’re losing you’re always a winner at Harrahs
50,Fun fun fun weekend and Harrahs experience was fantastic . A must do if you are visiting New Orleans. From the rich and delicious foods in the restaurants to the friendly and attentive wait staff. My overall experience was wonderful
20,Rooms are very nice. Food good. Good location. Close to convention center. French quarter. Arena and dome. Casino full of scammers and vagrants at night along with panhandlers. I felt unsafe and contacted security so many times they gave me their phone number! Cab drivers rude in NOLA!
40,I was unable to get a room at the Harras hotel but they found me one at the Hilton riverside hotel. that hotel within easy walking distance.The stay there was nice. In the casino the delivery of drinks was very slow.
50,We had a wonderful weekend! The front desk upgraded us to a river view at check in. It was a large clean comfortable room on a higher floor. The entire staff was very accommodating down to the last minutes of our stay with the valet crew. Would highly recommend.
50,"The hotel, valet, cleaning staff were all very friendly and professional, they welcome me as though I had a personal relations this meant a lot to me and my spouse. I would define recommend this hotel to others who are or will be visiting the NOLA are"
50,"I would Highly recommend Harrah's New Orleans. Friend and I had a great time there and are already discussing going back. The hotel and rooms were extremely clean, modern, and up to date. The room was very spacious and the bathroom had double sinks. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Concierge was knowledgeable of local restaurants with true cajun & creole food. Location great: walking distance to bourbon street and Jackson square. Casino clean with a lot of slot machines. Main area is smoke free Smoking is in a separate area"
50,I enjoyed the exciting atmosphere. The beautiful surroundings in the Hotel and Casino lifted my enthusiasm to just relax and enjoy the moments. My visit from start to finish gave a feeling of being a tourist on vacation in my own hometown of New Orleans. Sharing this with friends and family makes sense to share a place for enjoying and building wonderful memories.
50,"Location for Harrah's is great for all attractions in New Orleans; French Quarter, National WW II Museum, Aquarium, and Riverwalk shops. Casino is a definite plus to our stay and the casino play is on par with Las Vegas."
50,"This Hotel exceded my expectations. Very nice room with comfortable beds, This is a hugh Hotel with nice restaurants and a gift shop. Very busy place but central location which makes it a easy walk to wherever you need to go"
50,The room was the greatest the desk clerk upgraded me to a suite when I checked in and the room was one of the nicest i have ever stayed in. The casino was a lot more than I expected very modern and the personnel were great. I have a lot of casinos close to my home but Harrah's New Orleans is above all of them.
40,Nice rooms and handy to get around New Orleans. Dragos has the best chargrilled oysters. Use a peddler to get over to Jackson Square. The Gazebo Café has the best Hurricanes in New Orleans by far. They also have an awesome Ice Cream Pina Calada.
50,Beautiful property with excellent customer service. Casino attached to property is very convenient. Close enough to walk and tour the city. Very close to cruise docks. Was able to access ride to ship very easily.
50,Employees were friendly and helpful. Casino is a little tight but fun. Convenient to a plethora of restaurants and bars. I recommend self parking as daily rate is $40 plus. Self parking is right there at the hotel so not really an inconvenience.
50,"Four Canadian retiree ladies wanted to go away for a few days so a trip to NOLA was arranged. I made the reservations at Harrah's New Orleans mainly because my husband and I had stayed there several times before with excellent results. Great staff, very clean rooms, and the location near the French Quarters and travel services were a plus. The ladies were extremely pleased with my choice. Thank you for making our trip such a success."
40,"The room was clean and furnished well. Traveling with my parent, I was able to get rooms that were side by side making it more comfortable for my Mom. she felt safer and at ease knowing we were right next door."
30,My girlfriend and I stayed at Harrahs NOLA from Nov 5-9. We had a nice time and we walked everywhere. The room was very nice and clean and the Casino was also rather nice and clean. Most employees were friendly with the exception of a few. The buffet was terrible however. $32 per person and had very few options and food quality was poor. My girlfriend was terribly sick within an hour of eating. We weren't even drinking and it was not even 5pm. We spent the rest of the night in the room with her being ill. The next night we went exploring. I leave my money in the room with the privacy setting on the door. We had to run back up for something and the maid was in our room. The next day I was missing $100 from my bag. I still can't believe it! I've never had someone…
50,Thank you so much for an incredible time in the big easy!!!! We were really looking forward to staying at Harrahs but they were full so they put us in the Hilton Riverside!!!! We had so much fun! Thank you❤️
50,"It’s always a nice stay at Harrah’s’s. Rooms are super nice and service and staff are as good as any hotel in the French Quarter area. Free parking if you gamble is a real plus too. Easy walking distance to all the French quarter bars,restaurants,shopping and entertainment. Rooms stays can be pricey if you’re not a rewards member but if you want a great hotel and great location you can’t go wrong. Don’t expect to get rich at the casino if you gamble on the machines. Very tight on the payoffs especially compared to some of the lesser known casinos in nearby Mississippi. I love New Orleans and a Harrah’s stay will ensure your visits will be great as well."
50,"Wow what a great place! Wonderful rooms, plenty of restaurants and perfect location. This resort has everything for visitors to New Orleans, we loved it all! The hotel is super clean and comfortable and the casino has many choices to play. Loved it 😊"
20,The place is a maze. Felt like when we reached our room there should have been cheese there. Lord help you if you park yourself and try to refind your car. Even the bellman got lost. The beds were nice. The ceiling had a hole in it where perhaps a smoke alarm might fit. All in all NOT a very pleasant trip.
50,"Very clean suite with beautiful views. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, especially in the hotel. Abundance of towels and toiletries. Best coffee in town is at the blue spot...on the way to the casino. Food quality and variety is excellent. No staff or service issues to distract from experience... Priceless. Relax and enjoy."
50,"I love stayiing and playing at Harrahs. I get treated like a Queen and wether its the hotel or casino, i feel like they really are happy to see me. I get hugs from all the emplyees and they feel like family to myself and my son. our rooms are great and often upgraded to a suite. the food is very good at the buffet, and the Steakhouse is special with its unique menu and fresh seafood and steaks. I cant wait to get bk there again"
50,"The rooms, location, and customer service is hard to beat here. Everyone and everything has been perfect. I’m picky and this stay was absolutely flawless. Our rooms were beautiful, quite, and spotless. 👍👍"
50,"while I did not stay overnight this trip, I have in the past. The rooms are nice and the staff are very attentive. They acknowledge you as soon as you walk up and it they are busy, they say someone will be with you shortly. Great food within the hotel and casino."
40,"The hotel is showing a little age; but still a great place to spend a couple of nights. Wonderful front desk staff, especially Mark at the Concierge desk. Convenient to downtown, adjacent casino, French Quarter and street car. Free parking if you gamble 30 minutes in casino daily; but parking machines don't work well and rules concerning in/out privileges are complicated. Too bad the parking problems taint the great job everyone else at the hotel is doing. Mark can fix anything!"
30,Room was nice clean and enjoyed the stay was very pleased with hotel and the room attendants were very nice and helpful over Erall a great experience as far as hotel it was a nice trip to take my brother for Halloween
50,Stayed here 4 nights mid October. Very friendly hotel with nice lobby and layout. Everyone was courtious at all hours. The room was very clean and accommodating with comfortable beds overlooking the river. The location is good and within walking distance of many activities with bars and good restaurants right there.
50,"Great staff makes for a great stay. From Michael greeting us at the door and providing directions to our next outing, to Mark at the concierge desk walking over to the casino to move our dinner reservation up 1 hour everyone seemed focused on making our stay special."
50,"Harrahs was a great place to stay. Great rooms, service and helpful people. Trolly ride from French quarter Casino was a good place for all of us to meet, eat and have some fun. Not our first visit and certainly not our last"
30,"Great hotel, casino not so much. No food comps. Hotel was really great with employee treaters and friendly staff. Casino not much interaction with staff. A slot perso n did come by and said hello but that as it"
50,"Great location, good value for the money. Restaurants are very good. The hotel staff was helpful. Casino tunnel is a great idea. No smoking in the casino except for one area. The hotel is within walking distance to all the top sites."
50,The room was plush. The front location was facing the casino. Just had to only cross the street to loss my 💰 won some though. Being there at Halloween was so much fun. There was enough excitement there at Harrah’s that we did not have to go far for fun.
10,"Stayed two nights at Harrah’s Hotel. Only went into casino one time. Casino was the dirtiest place I have ever been. Sorry service for attempting to get a drink order from a machine. Any other place we get complimentary juice, sodas and pretty sad whenever they want to charge for a bottle of water. I sure hope they enjoy our money spent because we have been in New Orleans Harrah’s for the last time. I would NOT recommend Harrah’s New Orleans to anyone...."
50,"Always have compted rooms. Dining choices on the property are excellent. Location of the property to other venues, restaurants, shopping selections, entertainment and sights is superior. The employees are courteous and friendly."
50,"We stayed at Harrah's Hotel for one night upon returning from a 7-day cruise. We were very happy with the accommodations, the staff and the location. Everyone was very friendly and helpful in guiding us to local places of interest and good places to eat."
50,"Harrah's is always accommodating, it's in a great location, rooms are fabulous...and gambling wasn't too bad either haha. Complimentary rooms is a very nice perk. We had the breakfast buffet. Dinner is probably better, but hey, it was free food, we have no complaints. Thank you!"
50,"Harrahs is nice, good games, lots of entertainment , I won a couple of thousand this trip, which was much needed given the fact that the last 10 trips was completely bonkers.... I was upgraded to a suite free of charge which was nice, beautiful hotel and great view!"
50,"Spent a few nights at Harrah's NOLA and was impressed. Rooms large, comfortable, and equipped with great amenities. Very close to several great restaurants and right across the street from the casino. Staff is very friendly and knowledge. Room service (eggs benedict) was very good and reasonable. Will definitely stay there any time in the area."
30,"Parking garage is difficult to get to due to one way streets. Valets are very helpful. Rooms are nice but short on drawer space. You must walk under or across the street to get to the casino. The casino is huge and the signage is not helpful. Dining choices are limited. The buffet is a 2 star and way overpriced. The concierge service is very poor, but the front desk people are very nice as are the floor people in the casino. The poker room is great: very short wait and a variety of games. Safety outside, forget it."
40,"Great hotel very close to the casino and the French Quarter. Trolly about 50 yds from casino entrance. Can park free in the casino garage with a players card and 30 min of play per day. Casino is non-smoking, however there are slots outside for smoking. Hotel has only a small coffee bar across the breeze way. Otherwise there are restaurants all over the place."
50,"The room was very nice, The people who work there were friendly and helpful. The reason we were there was because of my husband's birthday. We both had a memorable stay. So awesome :) We definitely would recommend the hotel to our friends and family."
50,The room was very nice and comfortable. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is closed to all the attractions in New Orleans. The hotel is not far from the river walk and french quarters.
30,"My room was good, above avg. The maid service very good, and the hotel service was excellent. Casino service needs some work. Some of the employees not very friendly or helpful and basically acted uninterested in helping. Buffett was good not excellent and the service was also good. thx"
50,"The location is perfect walking distance to the French Quarter, Canal Street, and the beautiful river walk! The casino and the hotel were both immaculate, and the staff was more accommodating then you could even imagine! Highly recommend staying at this location!"
50,Great hotel! The service was terrific. The location was excellent. The casino was super. Mannings was a great to eat and it was very close to the hotel.. I plan to return and visit the great city of New Orleans!
50,"Rooms were great, best pillows,I have ever slept on !! Food was excellent,bartender named Wendy was the best bartender,funny lively Had us in stitches,introduced herself,and remembered our names She wasGREAT"
50,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff including the bellmen, conceirge, houskeeping, doormen, and front desk personnel. Clean and very well maintained property. Proximity to Casino through a tunnel is an added bonus in bad weather."
50,"This is a great place to go if you like to gamble and/or you simply need accommodations near French Quarter, Bourbon street and the like. The accommodations are clean and there are plenty of restaurants inside of the casino and then directly outside. You can walk to everywhere from this location. No complaints! Fun time!"
50,the beds were extremly soft and comfortable I slept almost as well as I did at home. the rooms were also exceptionally quite also. cleaning staff were very friendly and accomadating the front desk staff were friendly everyone seemed pleased working there and were always smiling great time
50,Stayed at the Hilton Riverside as Harrahs was booked. It was convenient. Enjoyed the service on the casino floor. Enjoy the fact you can order right from the machine that you are playing at which is very convenient.
50,"Room Maids Front Desk Waiters Slot Attendants were all great. Did have a rainy day, but the front desk came through with an umbrella. Harrah's New Orleans was close to everything Boubon Street & The Mississippi River Walk Etc."
50,"Had all my favorite slots, and of course table games. The Steakhouse was fabulous. Also ate at Fuddruckers. Stayed at Harrahs hotel and it has a cool passageway from hotel to casino underground that was bright, out of rain lol and staffed with friendly security!"
50,We had a wonderful trip to New Orleans. Harrah's is a top knotch establishment. The service was great. The rooms were spotless and pretty. Had a great time in the casino. Would highly recommend staying at Harrah's.
50,"Hotel is convenient to shopping at the Riverwalk, Canal Place & other retail stores. A wide variety of restaurant fare to choose from. You have upscale Ruth Chris Steakhouse & Harrah’s Steakhouse. Casual and delicious Grand Isle, Manning’s Sports-bar & Restaurant, & Gordon Biersch with an in house brewery. Fulton Alley has fun food and bowling. And there are a number of fast food venues nearby including McAllisters, Fuddruckers, & Lucky Dogs in the Casino. For seafood there’s Acme Oyster House in the casino and Dragos in the Hilton Hotel a block away. And for a huge variety The Harrah’s Buffet is always open The aquarium & insectarium are in close walking distance also. There is no need for a vehicle to enjoy all these amenities and if you wish to to venture further out, Uber &…"
50,"I find Harrahs New Orleans to be a top-notch hotel destination. The hotel is very well maintained, the front desk staff is very courteous and equally efficient and the rooms are spacious and clean with comfortable bedding. The ambiance and excitement in the casino is incomparable. I'm always thrilled when the mardi gras floats and second line bands come in the casino on the weekends & people stop gambling to party down & have a ton of fun!!!"
50,"Everything about this place is great. The people are terrific. It would be nice if they had a pool area but there is so much to do in New Orleans, it was not an issue. I highly recommend visiting New Orleans and staying at Harrahs."
30,"The Casino has changed and both of our favorite Hosts have left, no one could explain why. Room was great, people in hotel very helpful and polite. My host just talked to me 1and 1/2 days before we came, I get there and he is gone, no one knew why( which I do not believe)"
50,"Once again, Harrah's New Orleans provided me an amazing time! My Casino Host, the fantastic staff in the VIP office, the friendly folks in the buffet and hotel all together set the stage for me to have nother short of a great time."
50,"Great location and great river view from my room ,center of everything and everywhere I needed to be with pretty updated rooms and very friendly staff.i will surely return and stay there again,I feel it greatly enhanced my trip"
50,"Hi everyone, if you are looking for an incredible stay in NOLA please stay at this hotel. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Rooms are incredibly clean and modern. Cleaning staff do an amazing job. Front desk is very helpful. The location is perfect to get to anywhere in the city!."
50,the rooms were great . the staff was top gun. Make sure to try Mannings and the other eatery in the casino . good food . Ask staff what is going on outside the hotel and they are happy to help . Visit the WWII museum
50,This is a great casino for gaming and quality service. Our room was delightful and the casino is in an ideal location to visit other places in New Orleans. The buffet was excellent with foods native to New Orleans. I highly recommend it!
50,Great Place to stay. Near the French Quarter and all the action! Staff is always so friendly and accommodating. Property is clean and well kept. Great restaurants nearby as well. We stay here every time we come into New Orleans!
50,"We love Harrah’s New Orleans. Their no smoking policy lets us go in regular clothes and stay longer without burning eyes and needing a bath as soon as e leave. We love Acme food, their great service and variety of slots."
40,"Convenient. close to everything walking distance. Fun! Can make money while on vacation! ;) However, the minimum on the tables are a little high for people on a budget, so make sure you bring enough cash to play!"
50,"The front desk employees & ladies were very accommodating. They welcomed us when we arrived. Our room is very clean & have enough toiletries & towels. Enjoyed the coffee in the morning at our room.Our room have a good view.,fronting the Harrah's casino."
50,"Had some business meetings in New Orleans and I am so glad I Picked Harrah's New Orleans. Rooms were great, the choice of Restaurants right on the property was amazing, and having the Casino killed the little bit of free time I had. Along with being convenient to the French Quarter now going to have a book a trip for fun."
50,"Rooms at the Harrah's New Orleans are spacious and very clean. The large bathrooms with deep soaking tubes are an added bonus. The beds are nice and comfortable. Front desk staff are super friendly and answered my questions. Play 30 min a day in the Casino and garage parking is free. The Casino is pretty nice. Walking distance to many attractions in NOLA. And most important, not haunted!"
50,The Harrah is a big and beautiful place to visit. That staff is friendly and they were very helpful. It was our first time and we didn’t know what to expect. I am looking forward to visiting again soon.
10,Hotel was very nice but the host and some of the staff was so rude . I've stayed at many harrahs properties and usually they are incredibly nice and helpful but the staff I interacted with acted like you always bothering them. Didnt honor the promotions I had which was new for me at a harrahs resort as well.
50,"A wonderful break from heat or cold to have some grown up fun!!!! Wonderfully decorated with a New Orleans atmosphere. The food is good and the rooms are luxurious!!! The staff is incredibly helpful, and personable."
50,"Harrah's New Orleans is a fabulous place to stay. Rooms are exceptional as is the service. Location is probably one of the best in the city - easily walkable to all that New Orleans has to offer - French Quarter, Bourbon Street, river front. Doesn't get much better."
30,Good location for the city. Everything’s walking distance. Wear comfortable shoes. If your going there to gamble you will be disappointed. They don’t comp like they do in Atlantic City or Connecticut . Hotel staff not that friendly.
40,My husband and I just love this place. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are comfortable. The casino is smoke free and it’s wonderful! The only reason I gave it a 4/5 is because we would love for this property to have a spa!
50,First tie to stay at Harrah's and was very pleased. Nice room; nice value; great service. Would stay here again. A little further to the French Quarter but closer to the Casino end of the area. Upgrade to a suite.
30,They are working on improving this property. I visited in July and October and the remodeling team is still working in the area between the lobby and casino. Staff was very friendly. My issues are: The room type I had reserved was not available and the room I was assigned was not as clean as I would have hoped.
40,Really love Harrah’s hotel & casino. The staff are friendly & helpful. Had a great room with a nice view. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a place to with a wide variety of things to do!
50,"Room was excellent. At $42 a night to valet park, you will want to use the self park garage for sure. It will be be free if you play for at least 30 minutes a day in the casino which was no problem for us. Do beware depending on your room location, you will get a loud 5:30-6 am wake up call from very loud train horn from the tracks between the hotel and the river."
50,"Heavenly bed large accommodations, friendly staff great trip. Located in the heart of the French quarter. It's only a short distance from the ruby slipper restaurant and well very close to bourbon st."
20,"I was in room 1215, cleaning service did not do a good job (toilet paper low, did not leave extra roll [2 nights], ice bucket water and cup not emptied for 2 nights, cups in bathroom not replaced, found a ear phone set left in bathroom by maid.) Homeless woman claiming to be maid service tried entering room, security called. Fire alarm went off on two separate days [first time could not enter hotel, second time we were to checkout and had to evacuate, walked down 12 flights with luggage.] I think their system was malfunctioning."
50,I love staying at Harrahs New Orleans. The people who work in the hotel and casino are extremely helpful and friendly. I especially appreciated the personal attention I got from Grachelle at the caesars rewards desk. She went out of her way to be of assistance. The rooms are fabulous. The casino offers a lot of options. The Laurel Lounge is a great place to relax and have a drink and a bite to eat.
50,Beautiful large rooms. Hotel in perfect location to walk to most areas. Only one block from Riverwalk outlet shopping. Very large location with lots of stores. Nice riverwalk pathway lining the Missippi river. River cruises locted right there. The casino is across the street but you can also get there by a tunnel connecting the hotel and casino. There are plenty of restaurants right next to the hotel and several places to eat in the casino.
30,"The Harrah's New Orleans is nice, but quite set back from the initial entrance into the casino off Canal. This makes for a longer walk to reach the edge of the French Quarter than one might otherwise think. The rooms are really nice and well appointed, and in fact are reasonably priced, at least compared to most hotel rooms around he FQ. But unless you're a high roller in the Caesar's chain, which owns Harrah's, then parking is a freaking ripoff, up to $55 per day, altho we managed to get it priced down to $30, but only because that's what we were quoted at check in. If you don't mind the expensive parking or the long walk to reach the FQ, then you might like this hotel. We didn't and it's why we only stayed there one night."
10,We arrived after a long flight to find out they have overbooked and gave no room available. Desk not very helpful. Finally transferred us to the Hilton The Hilton was amazing and met all our expectations
50,"My friend and I had an excellent experience at Harrah's recently. Ms Luvonda Lanier was extremely helpful, pleasant and cordial. She is an excellent host and represents your company in a very professional manner"
50,"Location is great easy to get to everything. People are so nice and very helpful. Lots of machines to choose from and great food. The buffet is excellent, the food to choose from is extremely beneficial to the customer."
50,"love the solts you got to try them and win ,also the food court has alot to offer, and in overall the staff is really helpfull and freindly no matter who you are ,they will take care of you like VIP thank you"
40,"The location was great. You can easier walk to where everything is happening. Rooms are a really good size and the staff is good. Buffet not the best in a city where there is so much good food.This hotel connects to shops and food, and is across the street from the casino."

50,Excellent customer service all around from the minute we arrived as guests until we checked out. This is definitely Team Work and that take effort and motivation and compassion for people. And they have it all here I would totally recommend Harrah’s New Orleans to anyone visiting. There for work conference but it was great and the best food ever!!!
40,My stay was comfortable. The rooms were neat and clean. The Staff were all friendly and helpful. I’ll definitely stay here again. There is an underground pedestrian tunnel connecting the hotel to the Casino. It has security stationed at the entrance and is quite safe to navigate alone.
50,We love staying at Harrah’s. They are consummate professionals and always make us feel most welcome. The rooms are lovely and The French Quarter and the trolleys are within easy walking distance. The casino is clean and lots of fun.
50,Fun place to stay. Nice rooms and friendly staff. Non smoking casino too. Convenient location. Close to everything. Within walking distance of Bourbon St. and a short ride to Magazine St and the Garden district.
40,"Great City and Casino. All of the staff at Harrah's go above and beyond to help you and provide suggestions for what to do in the city and at the Casino. We had the Dinner Buffet, it was excellent. The food and service at the buffet top notch. We are looking forward to coming back again!!"
50,"A wide variety of machines with friendly staff members willing to help out. Clean and fresh looking. Smoking areas with even more machines, some of which you cannot find inside. Fast drink service. Clean rooms"
50,Great first trip to New Orleans! Loved everything! Hotel accommodations were great! Loved the no smoking in the casino which is where i spend a lot of time. Manning’s was great for finger foods and watching the games!
30,It’s was overall a nice beautiful room over looking the city... but the stand ups take in to much to give a little so I need the payout to give up More money I also would like the casino to provide a tour of the city
20,Hotel room was nice but very hard to get into parking lot with construction fence up and parking ticket validation machine not working part of the time.Did enjoy the river cruise brunch and alligator tour.Also seen how the parade floats are maid.At night stay on a main street with a group a lot of things happen.Friend grandchild had to see some buddy get stabbed and police stay busy at night you will hear the sirens.
50,"Wonderful stay, accommodations, room, service and staff were always on top of it! We were always greeted night or day. The beds were so comfortable, room exceptionally comfortable! Clean room, bathroom spotless. Service was exceptional!"
50,The room we stayed in was very nice. Very comfortable bed and the area we were in was very quiet at night. I particularly like the non-smoking policy! There is a good range of food options in or close to the hotel.
50,We loved Harrah's. The hotel room was clean and spacious. Staff very friendly and helpful. Casino was nice. Everyone very friendly. Great location to restaurants and shops and we had a gorgeous view of the river from our room. Only complaint is buffet for breakfast does not open till 8am. We booked a tour and had to leave at 740 so had to use the pricey room service.
50,Superb service and accommodations. Easy access to all city transportation. Buffet was excellent. Staff was very accommodating to our needs. Thank you Harrahs for a great quick trip to New Orleans. Look forward to returning soon.
50,This hotel is amazing. Everything about this hotel is pure luxury. The hotel was kind enough to upgrade our room to a suite complimentary. We’ve stayed here numerous times and every time was excellent!
50,"Spent two days in New Orleans staying at the Harrah' Hotel. As usual, the personnel were personable and professional making sure that our visit went smoothly. Any questions I had were answered promptly."
50,"The room was very nice, clean, it had everything we need. And it was the quietest hotel room we've had in a long time! We were right over a busy street but couldn't hear a thing. And no loud guests from other rooms in the hall. ALL of the employees were very nice, very helpful and friendly."
40,Paid for my accommodations myself. No offer from Harrah's. The Intercontinental Hotel was great. Wonderful location. The staff were responsive. The room service was fantastic.The room was spacious and the out side patio was also great. I would recommend the Intercontinental to anyone.
50,"I stayed at the Harrah’s Hotel and loved it. It was a great time. The crew Lesley, Kenneth, Robert And Mark are all so helpful and nice. It was truly a good time. My room was all that I could ask for and easily accessible to the elevator. Out was home away from home. The coffee shop opened downstairs at six am and I could go downstairs and get morning cappuccino for us to begin each day. Visiting the casino was fun too. And the visit wasn’t complete without a visit to the Steakhouse, as well as Ruth Chris And Gordon Biersch. We had such s good time. I heartily recommend it."
50,"This steakhouse used to be a John Besh place. It wasnt that great but now has changed hands and is awesome!! We had a delicious dinner with six people, and everyone was thrilled with the meal. Our server, LANGSTON, was super fun and made our dinner extremely pleasant. It is a beautiful place, with George Rodriquez Blue Dog artwork everywhere. I would highly recommend this next time you are visiting the casino!!"
50,"Since this was my first visit to NOLA I just had to check out Harrah's Casino. We found some quality items to purchase at the gift shop. The casino floor is clean, and the decor is cheerful and inviting."
30,"My husband and I got there on a junket at 1:00 pm with 23 other people. We were the first to check in. Our room wasn't ready so we waited. When the room was ready, it was too far from the elevator. I have trouble walking so I ask for a room near the elevator. Our room wasn't ready until 4:15 pm. We were the last people in our group to be checked in. We had a view of the parking garage (403). The drapes didn't close all the way. Soon as the sun came up, the whole room lit up because the mirror across from the window reflected the light from the window. We went to the Buffet on Thursday. It was dreadful. There was no ice cream. The bread pudding was hard and dried out. It had no taste. The rest of the deserts were awful. You don't have real butter. I put too much…"
50,"when headed to New Orleans, Harrahs is the place to go. Hotel is beautiful, clean with excellent staff. They know everything to do and how to get there. They bend over backwards to make it a memorable stay. Friendly and knowledgeable for anything you want to know. Gaming across the street is absolutely fantastic! Huge selection of slots and tables. Never a dull moment with all the Dixie and blues bands cruising the game floors. It’s is in a great area, close to everything."
50,Rooms are excellent and truly first class. Good New Orleans food at the casino and surrounding area. Casino employees are friendly and always ready to help. Can not help but have agood time. Good activities at the property and in the city.
40,"Nice quaint place and the best bar food I've had. The Nachos were great people around me kept on asking what that amazing smell was. The concert hall was just the right size, you are able to get right up to the stage."
50,Great hotel. Convenient to everything. Beautiful hotel. The rooms are spacious and the fitness center is accommodating. Parking is easily accessible and the on site restaurants are the best. I will definitely be staying here when visiting New Orleans.
40,Will definitely five the room a five star rating My hostess was awesome. Service at the Laurel lounge was satisfactory. Steakhouse food and service were reasonably good. The best feature was the suite with a magnificent view and interior decor very appealing.
40,"Smoke Free Casino (huge +), that was friendly and attentive. Went two nights on a family trip. There was enough variety and no lines for tables. The loud dj music on Friday + Saturday Nights was a bit much, and would have preferred it to be turned down but other than that, good time,"
50,We only used the casino. It was my wife's birthday so we were just looking for something to do until the show we had come to see started. The casino was very clean and neat. We would recommend it to anyone looking for gambling entertainment.
30,"dont go to gamble....poor pays, service and attitude of most staff. Positive is non smoking and beautiful. Seems grand, but no fun if you cannot play long. Others discribed as you are a captive audience so Harrah's takes advamtage of the situation. We were there on a weekend afternoon and they were definitely not busy, but were not offered any beverage while playing. So sad as this could be a wonderful place to enjoy a full on experience in New Orleans. I do not know about the hotel, so cannot speak to that part of the property. The facility was clean and well maintained from my observations. It is well located in the center of the business district and there are many siteseeing opportunities in the area. If you enjoy gambling while traveling, I would not recommend this…"
10,"I'm a pretty chill person and don't get upset about much when I am on vaction - because I'm on vacation. I'm grateful - 99% of the time. BUT Harrah's made my reservation at the Hilton and asked for my opinion here. I absolutely LOVE Harrah's but the situation is this... I called to make a reservation through the HARRAH'S VIP line as I am a Diamond member through Total Rewards. They told me there was nothing available at Harrah's but the Hilton right next door was a property they use when they are full. She went on to say how nice it was, how convenient it was, that it is right next door...Here's the problem -- No one ever mentioned that even though Harrah's made the reservation and all the reservation information was on my Caesar's Rewards App, I would not be able to charge any…"
50,Me and my family always have a good time when we stay at Harrah’s The rooms are very clean and the staff is always helpful The casino has a good atmosphere and a good selection of slot machines and tables.
50,This was an amazing property! By far the best property in the Harrah's group that I have visited. The lobby and casino were clean and beautiful. The room was absolutely amazing and the bed was more comfortable than my $4000 Sleep Number at home. I will preface that last statement with the fact that I was upgraded to a beautiful corner suite but I would imagine the beds would be similar if not the same. The room service was good and the choices for meals were great. It is also located in a great spot for venturing out to see the French Quarters and Downtown. I have already booked a return trip.
50,"The Harrahs hotel is pretty, clean and has comfy beds with a great view. The gaming is fun and you even win some! A great variety of yummy restaurants are available. Cocktail service is good and the staff is friendly. We are made to feel welcomed and try to come once a month. It's our favorite!!! We also really enjoy the Palm/Laurel Lounge as this perk sets Ceasars apart from all others making it the BEST. Hoping things don't change as the new owners begin to evolve."
40,Harrahs New Orleans was supposed to be an enjoyable trip. Too much confusion. And my players card didn't recognize my name attached to the card so we did not get out discount on the room. The hotel couldn't fix it and I had spinal surgery so I couldnt go all the way back to the casino to get it straightened out
50,"There is no place like this city!!! I enjoyed the places where the locals go and I love the tourist spots. New Orleans food and hospitality will keep you coming back. Harrah's is one of the best hotels... First you are greeted like a celebrity, rooms are clean and the best. I love this place to feel comfortable."
50,My room was very nice. I enjoyed the restaurants the food was great and the staff was really nice. Didn't hit any jackpots but I enjoyed trying. Getting on in the city was nice great shopping areas nearby.
30,"Seven Stars player. Booked a 2-night room with wife, seven stars in her own right. Had a late Thursday night arrival from Atlanta (flight in at midnight, hotel arrival about 1a). At the last minute, my wife took ill. Cancelled her itinerary with $200 penalty. I honestly didn't think about our hotel reservation; but, frankly, as a Caesars player I've been horribly spoiled by accommodation when there have been modest problems over the 20 years I've played at their properties. (So, maybe Caesars has set the bar a bit high when it comes to my expectation.) I arrived solo at the hotel, anxious to check in and fall into bed. They asked where Bev was, and when I explained, they said they couldn't honor the reservation. (And the desk agent actually stopped her comments right…"
40,"This casino is a great facility. A lot of gaming options, condition is up-to-date & well maintained. The place is centrally located in downtown New Orleans - just far enough away from the French Quarter & staff is professional & friendly. Beverage service is non-stop & attentive. Will definitely be back next trip to the Big Easy!"
50,"I stayed at the Contempra Inn, which is close to New Orleans. Clean little Inn. Nice bed and bath and shower. It also have large Refrig with regular size freezer and microwave. My next visit will be totally different. I enjoyed the ducks outside of the hotel. The ducks presence gave it a lovely feeling. Drivers were careful not to run over the lovely ducks."
50,"I have stayed several times at Harrah's New Orleans. Being a local, makes it great, because you can drive there, spend the weekend, and feel like you're in another city. Employees are very accommodating, friendly, and upbeat. Definitely a great place to stay, and close to all the attractions in the City."
50,Had a great time with Tim the bartender playing video poker. Black jack table in smoking area is great to have. Crap tables need a few more 10$ tables. Food choices in and around casino are amazing. Shopping is also very good in and around casino.
50,"Arrived early, but did not have to wait long for the room to be available. Great service from check-in to check-out. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Rooms were clean and I had a great view of the Mississippi. This was my fifth visit to the hotel and will visit again."
20,We planned to stay for 3 days at the New Orleans Harrah's. Most of the slots in the smoking area (which is very limited anyway) were gone or shut down / out of service. It was filthy.The hotel service was good but the slot service took forever and was almost rude when their tickets and service systems didn't work. Pretty disgusted. We left after one day and went to Mississippi Hollywood. Had a great time there.
40,"Our room was great, and the service exceptional. In the casino the service was very good and friendly. The slot service was good also but the number of quarter machines was lacking. It seems penny machines are taking over."
40,Casino and hotel overall were very nice. Loced the bathtub. Only bad experience was waiting for beverages in the casino. Even when we pressed the button on the machine no one came so we went to the bar.

10,"It is always fun in NO and Harrah's is a clean, fun non smoking environment. I would recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting New Orleans. Lots of games to choose from. Free drinks when playing is always a perk."
40,"our room at Harrah's was lovely,check-in,bell service great.Unfortunately we could get only ONE night there & then had to move to HILTON around corner.Nice guy wheeled our bags over there,was nice also.No complaints---OTHER than it took me almost 3 days to get reservations based on my Diamond status with Harrah's.Finally after talking to about 5 agents I tried again & talked to PAMIER,who should be recommended & got rooms for me.So Harrah's needs to get good people like her"
40,"The room was very nice and clean but the casino was terrible. I had to get a new key card 3 times before one would work in the door. No paying machines, no rewards credits, no food offers. The food was good."
50,I will try to visit Harrah's New Orleans at least once a year. The food was great and everyone was courteous and helpful. Front staff was informative and was very knowledgeable about the hotel. we be back soon.
50,"Our 2 queen bed room was great. Clean, fully equipped with desk, TV and everything we needed. The bathroom was also nice and clean and the carpets appeared to be new or nearly new in the room and hall. The casino was huge with a lot of action. Decor reminded us of Las Vegas. Several restaurants and buffets were available without going anywhere. The casino was a ""no smoking"" property with smokers relegated to small patios with a limited number of slots. We really appreciated not having smoke and ashes all over the place."
50,"If you enjoy casinos I highly recommend Harrah's, New Orleans. First of all, it is smoke free! The lighting inside is not overly bright but more than adequate for older people like myself. The location of the casino is very convenient to excellent restaurants, sites you want to visit there and you can even walk over and sit by the great Mississippi River and watch the river traffic."
50,"I was just passing by my last time, but every time that I stayed with them it was a lovable moment, fresh and clean room, walking distance from the French market, right across the street from the aquarium,"
50,Fun and friendly. Always go to Harrahs. Love the perks. Keep up the good work. I wish the slots were a bit looser but hey that's gambling right. Staff is friendly and the vip hosts are always right there to help.
50,Came to gamble for a couple of hours with family and friends. The casino is a good size. Tv’s everywhere for sporting events. Many different games to play. Only turn off was some of the dealers were rude and acted as if they didn’t wanna be there. Overall good experience.
10,THe room smelled of smoke. They where sold out and when they wanted to move me I was out the hotel. The manager on duty was rude. Then when speaking with him on Monday he was still making an issue of me not being there to move.
50,"Room was great, Food was wonderful. Couldn't had a better Birthday Weekend. We were close to elevator which was great too. Easy to get around and easy to find each other. Get wait to return to your town."
40,"The room could have been updated (carpet needed replacing), wall personal mirror was about to fall off wall. However, the room was clean and we did not spend a lot of time in it. The casino was lively and the slots not to tight. Everyone on the floor was very courteous. Loved the atmosphere."
30,"Casino is where you can lose a lot of money. The slot machines do not payout. This was a complimentary trip to this casino and now I know why. Hotel was nice but it had a long walk to actual casino even though there is a ""tunnel"" to get to casino. Bathtub was the best part. Large tub was deep and that filled fast. Comfortable bed and pillows. Quiet on 18th floor. Room service did not serve all items on menu 24 hours and ran out of items. Front desk was very nice."
50,"Nice,clean and pleasant. Non smoking Casino,smoking area outside with machines outside. Would be happy to recommend this Casino to anyone. Many choices for food and drink. Many varieties of slot machines to choose from. There is a poker room and many black jack tables."
50,Great room and view-nothing more needed. The casino was the best-won more than expected. Really nice room and the staff was the best. We will return in two years for another vacation. The valet staff was friendly and ready to help.
50,"Every year the TS4L (traveling sister 4 Life) take a sister bonding trip and this year was to Harrahs' New Orleans. We had a wonderful time and a SPECIAL THANKS goes to our Harrah’s New Orleans host David Galley. He made our stay very memorable and we plan to return again. And the casino offers a large selection of slot games and although this is a non-smoking casino, they had smoking courtyards where you could smoke located outside but within the casino. We can't wait for our next trip and we're planning accordingly."
50,"I always enjoy my stay with you and this time we made it a family outing vacaction. My family the Assaf were in room 1307 with addition room for my grandsons and my other daughters were in room 2320 the Bobadilla. Many thanks again to your Excellent, outstanding hotel staff."
50,"We had a wonderful time with the exception of a couple of hiccups. The food was awesome and the people were great! The one problem was with a dealer at the craps table named Glen who was quite snappy because i'm not an expert at the game. I feel that if they help you to learn the ins and outs of the game it would be a better experience for all. I did have one dealer who helped me the whole time and it was great!! Her name is Angelica, overall it was so much fun I would definitely go back."
50,I always have lots of fun at the Harrah's casino in New Orleans. It's a great place to get out of the sun for a bit!!! A clean casino and a safe one too. The staff is excellent....Southern Hospitality at it's best!!!
50,"The Harrahs hotel is in a great location not so close to Bourbon Street but the mall and restaurants not so touristy. Casino connected by a tunnel, nice you don’t feel like gaming is the only Thing to do. Every one at the hotel is so hospitalbele. The Laurel bar is so hostitile"
40,"Good place if you want to play baccarat. There is at least six open tables at all times. Good cajun music and food to eat, but parking is expensive. Never seen the hotel. The streets near the casino are in construction when I came, so it was difficult to find the parking lot."
50,The employees were helpful and knowledgeable. We came down for Saints game and were happy to discover we could get free parking after 30 minutes play time We will definitely recommend this place to family and friends
10,The most miserable vacation experience of my life. Switched between hotels and treated with indifference by Harrahs. Misled and possibly lied to by Harrahs. They did little or nothing to correct the problems.
40,"Our experience was very good at the Casino, the food court venues, the buffet. All the staff was friendly, helpful, and very customer service focused. We did have a bad experience with service at Mannings. The food at Mannings was good, but the service was terrible.If not for Mannings I would rate the overall property at strong 5."
40,"We stayed serveral days st the Harrah's Hotel in NOLA. The rooms were of decent size and the beds comfortable. Staff are helpful and responsive. There is reasonable security. There is an underground tunnel to the casino if the weather is inclement. There are many nearby upscale and high quality restaurants, as well as sports bars and grills, and museums nearby. We had a comped room, but unlike other Harrah's sites we had been to there was an extra daily charge (basic internet was in the charge whether you used it or not), and parking was free (otherwise $30 a day) only if one gambled for at least 30 minutes each day. The basic internet was relatively slow."
40,Enjoyed the casino floor. Casino is a very lovely layout with multiple entrances convenient to the French Quarter. Plenty of table games with a great selection of PiaGow poker tables. 3 or 4 sections of slot machines and drinks can be ordered right from the slot machines with some optional complementary drinks available when gambling
50,Trip to Harrah’s was fun. The games were exciting. The play was nonstop. All of the people that I was there with had a wonderful time. We would definitely go there again if we were in the area. I give it 2 thumbs up.
50,"Very nice and convenient hotel. Excellent staff, no waiting at the front desk very quick to check-in and check out as well as when needing help. Very clean top to bottom and nice rooms you won't be disappointed."
50,"I recently visiting Hurrahs Casino in New Orleans for my birthday trip. I enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and wiliness to help. I felt the machines paid well, the place is clean, steak house is good, can't say much about the buffet I thought is could use a bit of sprucing up and the one time I ate breakfast there the food was cold. Not sure if they had a regular restaurant for breakfast I would have preferred that over the buffet"
50,"This place is celebrating a 20 years which is WOW and still going strong! Not enough great things to say about this place. Location is not my favorite, but they make it worth the trip and travel. Highly recommend."
40,Buffet was ok. We got it free with points. Nice variety but needed more attention. You could tell some items were sitting there awhile and needed stirring. Fried fish was dried out and hot items were not hoy
50,I didn't stay in the hotel but I had a business colleague who said it was very nice. The casino was spacious enough not to get lost in. I would have preferred a few more traditional slots and less of the newer electronic slots.
40,The room at Harrah's was very nice. The employees were helpful especially the front desk at the hotel. Had a lot of machines I like to play. I love the Buffalo and the Lightning games. Location of hotel and casino is excellent. Took a boat ride down the Mississippi.
50,"Great location! Harrah’s Casino is about 3 blocks from Bourbon St and The French Market. The casino Is a very clean facility and offers easy parking, lots of slots, card tables and choices for eating."
50,Great casino experience! Lots of slots and table games. Really enjoy this location you can start off gambling and then head out to enjoy bourbon st a couple of blocks away. Will definitely be going back to Harrahs!
50,"Recently visited New Orleans and the service and accommodations at Harrah’s were top notch! The staff members were friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful. We had dinner at The Steakhouse and I’m not exaggerating when I say it was some of the best food I’ve ever tasted. Only downfall is that we are there the first night which set all others up for failure as we compared everything else we ate to that experience and there was no beating it."
50,"Location great, as it is on the ""cleaner"" end of town. Some may prefer to be closer to Burboun Street, but it was an easy walk up Canal Street from the Casino to get to Burboun. Lots of great restauraunts near/walking distance. Everyone here- literally ALL staff were soooo super friendly and welcoming."
50,We go to Harrahs New Orleans multiple times a year and we always feel taken care of and have a wonderful time. Their staff represents true southern hospitality. The food is always good and the drinks are cold.
50,We had a wonderful double queen bed room with a view of the Mississippi. From our room we watched barges and Steam Paddle Wheeler on the river. Superior service and friendly staff from front desk to housekeeping.
50,If you are near Harrahs Stop in and go to the poker bar and say hello to Billy Ray. Excellent bartender and very knowledgeable of the town. We always check in there after we check into the hotel. He recommended a couple places we had not visited during past trips and we were glad we listened. He’s a seasoned professional who won’t disappoint or keep you waiting.
50,They have the best overall hotel and casino very close to everything.Also all the employees are wonderful.They will go out of there way to help you with anything you need.Also the rooms where great clean and up to date.
30,"Staff at KC goes out of their way to be friendly. Machines did not work well buttons stuck cards would not read, Hotel room hard to control temperature. Food options only OK have had better food at other Harrahs casinos."
50,I didn't stay at the hotel but next time i will the gambling room was clean the bathrooms was beyond clean customer service was impeccable gave me a card with no problem or hassle the attendants for the tables was fast
50,Everyone was so helpful and friendly. Everyone seemed to go out of their way to make sure they answered our inquiries with helpful hints and the right directions. This was my daughter's first trip to New Orleans and she loved it.

50,It. Was a great experience and I had a great time! So please let me know when I have some free money to come back! Cause I want to win a million more dollars as soon as possible so please call or text me
50,"It was really a fun trip. All the food was representing, a shout out to Daisy Dukes open 24 hours. We are ate Pat O’Briens at the music was right outside. Even the young kids beating the buckets melded in to an authentic experience. It was such an old part of town. We the bricks in the areas hundreds of years old. In the light of night the spirits come alive. Go to Harrahas at 12 to rock with some cool people."
50,"It was a lot of fun and i plan on going back. There was a lot to do, but we only had one day so we did not get to do as mutch as we wanted to do. I am looking forward to making anou ther trip next year."
40,Had a great time gaming and some good food to go along with that . This was a very good adventure I would recommend this trip for everyone that needs a weekend getaway it was very relaxing and entertaining.
50,Time spent there was a enjoyable and friendly experience would recommend a visit here if traveling to new orleans whether its to play or enjoy the food here.Looking forward to going back to try the Mannings restaurant
50,This hotel is huge and very clean. It is also in a great location. No need to rent a car. Security is always in plain site - so very safe and friendly. The restaurants in the hotel was priced reasonable and the food was great!!
40,Was in town for a bit visiting a friend and had an excellent experience at the harrahs. Amazing place with lots of fun and outgoing people! We had drinks in the masquerade with the ice bar and it was amazing.
50,"We recently went to New Orleans for a friends birthday and decided to spend a night at the casino. With New Orleans being old and partied in and a little stinky and dirty we didn’t expect much from Harrahs Casino but we were pleasantly surprised with how beautiful the casino was!! Immaculate gaming floor, drink services were fast and actually available for order right from the slots. Great table games. And a very friendly staff that displayed a ton of good old fashioned southern charm. If you find yourself in New Orleans don’t miss the opportunity to stop in and check this place out."
50,"We definitely enjoy this trip every time we visit NOLA! A must stop when your visiting! Friendly southern hospitality, we ate at the buffet and it was amazing! Anything and everything your tummy craves!"
50,I am never disappointed when attending this casino. I love the fact that the casino is smoke free and all of the employees are friendly and helpful. The casino is easy to access by car or foot when staying in the French Quarter. Every trip I plan to go to NOLA includes a trip to Harrah's.
50,"Outstanding property! Within walking distance of everything we wanted to do. Staff was great. Beautiful room. Will definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting New Orleans. Easy access and convenient location for dining, shopping and gaming."
50,"Check in was super quick and friendly. Room was beautiful, properly equipped and stocked with your expected amenities. Short walk to Bourbon St. and Dome. Service at the tables and slots was fine. Favorite part of our trip was the SERVICE. Everyone was happy, smiled, and courteous. Experienced several random...""How is your stay so far"" and ""Are you enjoying yourself, is there anything you need"" Can't wait to come back...."
40,Birthday trip for my sister and the Cowboys and Saints game Great experience Except you can't smoke inside Need a better variety of slots outside in the smoking area Really enjoyed myself Will be back to visit
30,"We give 3 stars due to location and some ambiance, but this “luxury “ hotel is a bit “tired”. Beds are comfy as well as pillows. Overall is pretty worn. Carpet is soiled. And not a fresh feeling at all. Front Desk are friendly but not overly engaged. The bathrooms in the lobby are filthy and leaking on the floor. The Casino is very “tired”. Dirty and never saw any cleaning staff—compared to other casino—where somebody is constantly wiping down machines and cleaning trash. The casino is very tight. We don’t expect to be big winners but a little play would be fun....now it’s quite boring to just sit and watch the machine.... The Diamond lounge is horrible. As Diamond players you now graciously get 4 drink tickets PER DAY? Hahaha. Funny! We spend $80 for what used to be a pretty…"
50,Harrah's New Orleans is a Beautiful Hotel and Casino. The rooms are Beautiful and clean the entire staff is friendly the foodis outstanding in all of the Restaurans. We enjoyed our stay. We look forward to coming back again.
40,":( road construction in front and side of hotel makes getting to parking garage difficult. :( parking garage pretty full hard to find a spot. ;( no orderly line system, ie. roped path at check in desk, so hard to track who was next for check in agent. ;( annoying insert room card to use elevator for all floors system. :( no swimming pool :( parking ticket machine fussy and a chore to get out :) room spacious, clean. :) nice bathroom with separate glass shower, separate toilet room :) casino across street ;) loose slots....actually pay you off once in a while unlike most casinos ;) 1/2 hour of gaming time can provide a ticket for free parking"
50,"The poker room is great. About 25 tables, with good dealers, and a lively crowd. Had a wonderful time last fall. The locals are open to guests and out of town visitors, not like some other casinos that I have visited, where the locals are not friendly to visitors."
50,"Property is excellent. Playing in high limit. Someone pushed cash out button, when I looked left to see who, another individual grabbed the ticket and cashed it before security even arrived. Entire thing caught on tape showing that thief cashed my ticket in less than one minute. After insisting there was nothing they could do, my wife called corporate and the casino manager. Finally, my $137.00 was (reluctantly) returned. Following night, similar, got me for $30. Filed complaint, casino refused to refund. I was told by several employees that this happens regularly. Watch your machine closely. I openly admit that I put my chair up and walked away from machine for seconds. I should have cashed out or called to have someone watch machine. Clearly, they need to get a handle on this.…"
40,"Love the casino, it is all smoke and children free. The food at the steak house was excellent as well as Ruth Chris'. There ae also lot's of several games to play on the casino floor and a fabulous poker room."
50,Great room - with a killer view of the river - modern and updated bed and furniture...Appreciated all the extras with the room - Great TV and free blankets - Many elevators and the casino was close and safe
50,"Thank you for all the amazing greetings, when entering the doors, also a special thanks to those ladies whom remember me and make me feel kinda like a family, as we cut up when entering. Also a great job from the girls and guys whom deliver my drinks... Thank you! Joshua McClellan"
40,Nice rooms. easy check in process. Casino is Vegas style very nice. Love having a Starbucks on site. Dealers are very nice and helpful. Be sure if you are gambling to stay at the hotel across from the casino not the Hilton.
50,The hotel is in a safe and nice location near to many restaurants and activities. There's nice restaurants inside the hotel already if you like to stay indoors. The casino is so beautifully designed and looks very festive. It's a happy place with very welcoming staff.
40,"I I have been there several times and it is a great location to all sight, trolleys, and food. We got in very late and were still welcomed extremely warm and friendly. They offer 24 hr room service from several places, kind of prices but great foid."
50,"I highly recommend the Harrah Casino New Orleans! The staff from the bathroom attendant, the waitress to the cashier were all wonderfully nice and friendly. They made us feel like an important member of the family. Definitely will visit again."
50,"Nice place to go for a short weekend. Short trip from airport. Lots to do around the area. Shopping, eating, culture. Great atmosphere in general. Table games were fun with the right people. Dealer was awesome she made it fun"
50,I love that the casino is non smoking as I hate leaving a casino smelling like an ashtray and coughing like I smoked all night. The staff is so helpful and very courteous. We will certainly be returning.
50,"The room was very clean and updated, the staff was very friendly and always very quick to help with everything we might need or have questions too. The casino was large with plenty of tables and slots. The entertainment was very good. The location was great walking distance to most anything you would want to do. Great food “ bunch was awesome” !!!"
50,"Hotel and casino are very easy to find, and is close to Bourbon street and all its beautiful glamour. Staff are friendly and great you with a warm smile. Area around and inside hotel are kept very clean."
50,My experience at Harrah's Hotel was outstanding. It's always clean and smell fresh upon arrival and the staff is always friendly. They greet you with a smile and theirs one bellman has been there for over 10 years and he always remember me and my family.
50,Everything was clean we were taken care of and everyone was extremely polite. I enjoyed being around people who were enjoying their stay there as well. I will definitely come back to the property. Thank you
50,Very happy with my experience! Employees were friendly! The casino is a smoke free place which is very nice! Very nice layout and plenty of room! Very happy with overall experience! Very nice and 2 thumbs up
50,"Great location, love the variety of slot machines in the casino, and the food choices are awesome, Go there, give it a try, Thank me later, the location is very close to many restaurants and shopping."
40,"Location is great, tables are reasonable, lots of slots...I always have fun, win or lose. Being that it's the only casino in the area, it can be tough to get on tables during times that other events are in town"
40,"Rooms were nice, hotel was clean. The parking situation was garbage if you are staying at the casino. You cant take your vehicle anywhere because you have to pay everytime you leave. Other than that the hotel was clean and location was very convenient. We love New Orleans and will be back soon. It would be nice to win some money out of that tight casino though."
50,I had a great time! Easy to navigate! Centrally located. Staff was nice. Felt safe. Enjoyed the second line /band that traveled throughout the facility. It was clean. Outside there were options for transport.
50,"awesome place to gamble and stay at there clean hotels, all servers and attendants were very helpful and great we even won some money to take home...the hotel was clean and quiet beds were very comfortable, we will be back"
50,Harrah’s New Orleans was awesome and fun . Room was clean and comfortable. This is my first time at Hilton riverside it was close to the river walk and all the great places to eat and hang out at. The workers was very friendly and helpful
40,"Good Location, Cleanness, No smoking, Free Parking, Variety of Machines and Spaces. The layout of new slots and old slots are easy to identify. KIOSK to print new card, ATMs are scatter through out the Casino."
20,Service was terrible. The Buffet food was not much better. The crab legs and shrimp they served was very disappointing for being on the coast. The people working there were rude and unfriendly for being a southern town. Twice I was given misinformation and those people thought it was funny when I went back and told them. I would not recommend.
30,"I would give it a 3-1/2 to 4 stars...not my usual 5 this time. I've been fortunate to have traveled to one of the best cities in America around 17 times. I have always loved New Orleans, the people, the food, the sights, the sounds. I have stayed MULTIPLE TIMES at Harrahs. The rooms are always clean and spacious. However, on this last trip, something seemed off. Although alot of the employees were gracious and friendly, but alot of the employees didn't seem to (a) enjoy their jobs; (b) had forgotten how to smile at the customers or (c) felt they didn't have to make us feel valued and welcomed. Kuddos to the limo drivers, the valet (to include bellmen), the front desk people (although they no longer have separate lines for each tier credit folks (i.e., Diamond and Seven Stars),…"
50,"Room was clean, nicely renovated. Beds and bedding very good. We had nice view. Room was comfortable temperature wise, shower was nice, easy to use. I liked the art of New Orleans. Husband had trouble using the tv."
30,"Ordered room service and after waiting an hour I try calling them with phone ringing forever with no answer. Called consierge, and they could not get them to answer either. Food was finally delivered 30 minutes later, and was supposed to be comped for my inconvenience which it wasn’t went I got my bill. Had to go out of my way to find a Mgr the next morning in order to get the room service comped."
50,"Great restaurants inside, lots of awesome slots to play. The club on the inside was amazing lots of fun great music. Drink service was fast the the drinks were great! I’m so excited to visit this place again."
50,I didn't win but I had a great time. Was clean & service was good. Plenty of table games & slots. Loved the variety. Wonderful way to spend a Saturday. I used uber and it was supper easy to get there and leave. I recommend the Bloody Mary's & Quick Hit Slots.
50,"Great city: shopping, food and stuff to see. Streetcars a great way to travel around. Didn’t see hop on hop off bus until later in trip. There is always next time. Of course always need the stop at Cafe DuMond for cafe au lait and beignets(?) yummy! Love Harrah’s... best place to stay!!"
50,"everything was fine at the property. the staff , gaming ,hotel ,all areas of the property were clean.the employees were helpful, and genuine. i would advise anyone to visit this property.as far as outside there property,there are plenty of bars, music venues, and entertainment."
50,"This hotel is simply a jewel in the New Orleans area. The rooms are wonderful. The bathrooms are magnificent and the customer service is incredible!!! From our arrival to our departure, all of our needs were met with care and concern, and we were always treated like important guests at the hotel. I can’t say thank you enough for making my pre-birthday trip an awesome one to say the least!! I can’t wait to come back and OH....a special thanks to our personal host (IVY) who always made sure we had everything we needed from the moment we arrived."
20,"Hotel Mold in showers, rugs need to be cleaned...overall rooms need a very good cleaning. Only Restaurant in hotel is Ruth Chris....no coffee or breakfast cafe. If you get a room with river view....it is a nice view....no pool."
50,The casino was a five minute walk from my hotel. Not only was it convenient but secure. It was extremely clean including the restrooms. The staff were very courteous and checked on guest regardless of card level. It was a fantastic experience.
50,Just visited the casino. It was clean and very nice. Lots of machines to choose from. Casino was not Smokey like other casinos I have been to. The smoking sections were outside. Restaurant had good food too.
50,"Lovely hotel experience in New Orleans. Great restaurants nearby and casino very assesable .Staff all very accommodating and friendly, my traveling companion lost her licence and consier helped tremendously.. Buffet was good but not great. Will definitely be back!!!!!!!"
40,"Great location within walking distance of many New Orleans attractions/restaurants. Although the hotel and casino are separate buildings, a tunnel under the street allows to get to both locations without fighting traffic.The staff was very helpful and wasn’t out of their way to meet our needs"
50,"The room was clean and spacious with a nice view. The staff is friendly and professional. I like how they make use of Ivy, the Computer concierge, which welcomes you via text messages and ask how everything is. Also, it says that you can text Ivy for any help or questions and this system is much faster and reliable than contacting the front desk which is normally busy!"
50,"great location, clean, staff was very friendly. The only thing I did not like was the reward points are 2 for each $1 you spend. The Diamond Lounge was smaller than most but the buffet was plentiful. It was my first time here, I would definitely return."
40,The location was perfect for all my sight seeing trips. Easy to find shopping and food. The building and rooms were clean. Nice quality of sheets and towels. The staff always greeted us when we passed by them.
40,"High room prices have always prevented our staying there, since Loew's and Le Meridien, nicer at half the cost, are just across the street but I like Harrah's for good service. Slot play is poor to average, about what you'd expect given their monopoly in NOLA, but drinks are free and service is very good--just order right from your slot machine. The best thing about Harrah's is the parking--just park in Harrah's garage on Convention Center Blvd.; gamble 1/2 hour or more in the casino using your player's card and swipe your card at the kiosk at the base of the elevators on first floor, which will issue a barcode validation. When exiting the ramp, insert your ticket in the machine, scan the bar code in the reader at the base of the machine and exit. Save up to $40/day visiting the…"
50,Tons of good slot machines to play. The lighting is great and just a fun place to hang out. Enjoyed watching everyone play the table games as well. Would definitely go back when I am in New Orleans again.
50,"Went to Harrahs for their 20th Anniversary party, WOW, what a party! Great music, foods and a parade. The team of employees work very hard to make this a experience to remember, and we will. Love this property"
50,"Stayed on bourbon st. With a balcony and pool for less than what Harrah's was going to charge. However, the rooms at Harrah's are very nice. If you gamble enough they will comp rooms and parking. Always fun."
50,Stayed overnight to attend a fund raiser for HandsOn New Orleans. Spent the night at the Hilton Riverside and was very pleased with the room. the riverwalk shops are only a few steps away and offer plenty of options for shoppers. I went to Harrahs later in the evening. There is a large variety of slot machines and many are fairly new. I felt safe at all times during my stay. I was concern about the walk from the Hilton to Harrahs but there were plenty of people even during the late hours. Overall it was an enjoyable evening.
50,"Location, Location, Location. Harrah's is located on the edge of the French Quarter (Canal Street) and close to everything. Rooms are nicely furnished and have a commanding view of the Mississippi River. There is plenty of gaming action to keep you occupied. The personnel are wonderful and try to make your stay the same."
50,"If you visit New Orleans, check out Harrah's for a great meal and some casino fun. Take the Trolley, or walk down Canal St. Check out Manning's on a game day during football season. The food is great and the people are all about Southern Hospitality as well as the folks in the Hotel. Harrah's and New Orleans compliment each other. Harrah's must be nice to work for as I've never encountered anyone working there who wasn't friendly and genuine. They make a mean Hurricane at the bar by the poker room and even the Lucky Dogs are great when you have the munchies!"
50,"I didn’t have much luck on the slot machines, but I enjoyed the evening nonetheless. Beverage servers and Players’ Club staff were friendly, fast & helpful! The property itself is clean, colorful and very open."
50,Our room was very comfortable and clean. The bed and sheets were a delight. The employees are all very nice and extremely helpful. Harrahs seems to always have some sort of fun activities going on Harrahs definitely knows how to throw a party! Will definitely go back to Nola!
50,"Friendly and attentive drink servers, a big variety of slot machines, also great location to get ready to go on your cruise and the shopping mall all is within walking distance. we would spend the night at the hotel next trip"
50,The fact that it's a casino is only a topping of the already beautiful building. Most people probably dont even stop between the entrance door and take a moment just to take in the tall ceilings and everything between. Then you walk in
50,"From the airport and back to the airport everyone was super friendly. Staff at Harrah's were exceptional. Our room wasn't ready, so they took us to the VIP lounge for free drinks and food. This site was within walking distance to the French Quarter, outstanding places to eat and visit and 2 blocks from The Mississippi River."
50,As usual the experience at Harrah’s was a 10. The hosts are so friendly and the accommodations were great. The buffet and other food choices has something fir everyone. I recommend this hotel for everyone.
40,"I has a very nice time on my visit. The food was great and the casino was very inviting and clean. Thd casino games where also interesting,bit a little too tight. Your hotel rooms were just amazing,with friendly service in elegant surroundings. I would recomend a hotel stay to any of my co workers and family friends."
30,"Beautiful rooms, very nice location, down from the basketball, and football stadiums, but amenities are terrible, no microwave in room or on floor, no working vending machines, and charging for waters."
30,It was just an okay experience no memorable events. The room was nothing special the slots were the tightest I have ever seen. We ate at Acme Oyster House and the service there was the worst I have ever experienced
30,When we booked our room we were advised we can have early check in and access to our room when we arrived it was not honored. Also we played in the casino several days and no luck I didn’t feel that they pay out very much on the slots
50,"I hit , machines were hot, lots of fun if u r in New Orleans, it helps break up walking on Bourbon street! Highly recommend going down for a spin in the Big Easy.come on down to New Orleans friendly staff great card games, hitting slots"
40,The location is near the Superdome and it is a good area. The staff are great. The surrounding area is being re-construction and renovation. It will be a great area in a couple of years. I will definitely give it a thumb up.
50,"We had a nice, clean room on a quiet floor. Housekeeping was helpful, filling my requests quickly. The concierge was helpful as always! Front desk staff always speaks as you come and go. I just wish they would check the batteries in the TV remote."
50,I enjoyed playing here. The dealers are great and a blast to play with. Great location in New Orleans! I would definitely come back! The club is open and in the middle of the casino. Great music played.
50,I had a wonderful time with my husband we ate dinner at the buffet and played the slots .Good time was had that evenning. Love all the new games and slots. Will be visiting again real soon. Happy there was no smoking air around.
50,"New Orleans was an amazing place to visit with friends. Lots of delicious food, LOTS of drinks, plenty of things to do and able to walk almost everywhere we went. Will definitely be making a return trip!!"
50,The Staff and the casino were great. It was a very enjoyable experience. The dealers were great and the parking was very easy. I had misplaced my rewards card and was issued a new one very quickly. I will stop in the next time I'm in New Orleans.
50,This was our First Time at Harrah's New Orleans and it won't be our last This Casino has the Old Las Vegas feel their Buffet is amazing and with the Walkway connecting the Hotel to the Casino it made for an exciting time
40,"Everytbing about the hotel and casino is clean, very nice change from bourbon street. The employees energy was so positive and energized that it even made you smile as you walked in the doors, from leaving my car to walking in my room I was served!"
40,"I didn't stay in the actual hotel, I was only visiting for the casino portion, but the building is very clean and is full of helpful and pleasant staff members. There are a variety of food option ranging from quick to upscale and I had a great time spending the afternoon walking around and taking it all in ."
40,"Location was great but construction around the parking area is a hassle. As far as the casino, it’s a good place to be. Plenty of machines to choose from. Quality of food is okay but could be improved."
50,"We had an upper floor river view room. quiet, relaxing, comfortable bed. The rooms are clean. All staff members are pleasant and eager to assist or answer questions. The morning doorman Michael has been there since the hotel opened and is always willing to answer questions about the city."
50,Very nice casino. It is clean and nice decor. Staff is very helpful. My husband uses a wheelchair and Had no difficulty maneuvering around. You can order a beverage right from the slot machine and it comes very quickly. The streetcar stop is across from the casino.
50,"Love the atmosphere and love the locations. This was my second time staying there, hope to keep going back price determining because it isn't cheap. Its a very popular hotel book as soon as you can. Hope everyone enjoys it like we did"
50,Great property. Friendly staff. In the heart of the city. Casino fast paced and fun. Entire property clean. Nice it is non smoking however do have outside gaming area for smokers. Transportation from and too airport very professional
50,"Good casino odds, smoke free, very clean, friendly people, good food. The room service is very quick and served hot. Easy to find your way around. Security every where. High roller limits staff very much fun"
40,Did not stay in room. Just gambled but classy harrahs design and setup with a little spice with a nice bar in the middle. Games where very similar to what I know from LV but also had a few games I am custom to being down in the south. Slots had a few games I like and see out in LV but played more table
50,"Good experience but slow on drink orders. Server appeared to be vey tired, but it was a hot and humid day. Visit your Boisier location frequently. Always receive excellent service at your properties. Looking forward to future visits."
50,My fave place to Stay. The rooms are beautiful and so comfy. It’s close to everything too. The customer service is usually A+. I like lowest floor closest to the elevator and they always try to accommodate me.
50,Everything here is great from check in to check out! Employees are friendly and helpful. Rooms are beautiful. Great location. Also my husband won a jackpot! Machines were paying very well during our stay!
50,Ms Leslie at the Front Checkin was incredible. The lighting in the bathroom needs to be brighter and the TV remotes need help. The room was clean and the staff went above and beyond typical service. The bed was comfortable.
50,"We book a regular room but upon arriving we were asked if we would like to upgrade for just a few dollars more which we did and talk about AMAZING! Our suite overlooked the city with BEAUTIFUL views> The customer service was NONE to be compare to! The young man ""James"" that checked us in was so kind, knowledgeable and welcoming. Thank You James"
50,"We are so thankful to Mike, our host, for arranging our weekend stay at Harrah’s Hotel. The front desk staff were so professional and welcoming. We were offered water and a newspaper upon our arrival. The room was spacious and equipped with the amenities needed. The Steakhouse was good. The Diamond Club has changed since our last visit but it was ok. We accepted the change. The slots were playing slow but consistent. Can’t wait to return soon."
50,"Loved the hotel rooms, loved the casino, loved the food. Staff were all welcoming and extremely helpful. I would recommend staying here to friends and family and I would definitely stay here again. Five stars for sure!!!!"
40,"Our trip was for a long weekend in NOLA. We checked in around 2:30 pm on a Thursday and was given an option to upgrade to a suite for $99.00 a night, which we eagerly accepted. Our suite had windows on three sides, so we had a view of the Mississippi River and the Warehouse district from our 21st floor suite. The room had a wet bar, couch, chairs, dining room set, beautiful bedroom and large closet. The bathroom had a separate room for the toilet. The shower and deep relaxing tub were separate. And we loved the double sinks and mirrors, with also a leather seat and area to do my makeup. The towels and amenities were plentiful. It's conveniently located across from the Harrah's Casino. And also a short cab ride or walk to the French Quarter or Cafe DuMonde or the many…"
50,"Played 3 card poker, always a great time at Harrahs. Harrahs is always clean and the staff are always friendly. I always stay and gamble at Harrahs when I can. The New Orleans Harrahs has always been one of my favorites"
50,Great layout and awesome staff. Highly recommend stopping by on your next visit to New Orleans. It is located in the heart of Canal Street and within walking distance to most of the Hotels in the area. Short walk to Bourbon.
50,Excellent customer service. Good food fun place to visit. Would reommend this location as a destination. Lots of things to do and see. A wonderful city to visit and enjoy the local culture. Five star rating on this property
50,"The atmosphere, people, and food are all great!!! Walking distance to lots of places. Most dealers are very friendly and helpful especially Sherry at Baccarat!!! Patricia at the buffet is great as well. The Lucky dogs are the best"
50,The hotel rooms here are a lot larger than other hotel rooms in the area. The location is perfect walking distance from anywhere downtown and in the French Quarter. Only a :15 walk to the Superdome. We stay here every time we are in New Orleans.
50,We love New Orleans and Harrahs’s is a great place to stay and play all of the fun new games. The employees are wonderful and appreciate you being there. It is easy walking distance to all the wonderful things NOLA has to offer.
50,"friendly and helpful staff very clean rooms, beautiful casino, but buffet could be much better in the heart of the city places easy to get to from harrahs very enjoyable time coming back in November for another great experience"
50,Great casino. Hotel convenient to anything we wanted to do. Problems were addressed immediately. Staff were always friendly and helpful. If I had tp point out something a wasn't com[letely satisfied it would have been Ruth Chris's in the hotel. Just not like to older established ones.
50,"We had a great time at Harrah's in New Orleans, greeted when we walked in the doors and good service at the players club, played viedo poker at the bar and again had great service and won a little money."
50,"Stayed 5 days at Harrah's. Room was modern, very clean & comfortable. Fridge in the room is a bonus. Staff is extremely friendly. Hotel location is in French Qtr, which reduces walking distance to destinations/sites in the French Qtr. Free drinks while gaming! Cocktail waitress were fast. Harrah's has 2 Steak Houses to choose from. Manning's Sport Bar had an excellent brunch menu & drinks menu. Free Live entertainment inside & outside of casino was an unexpected treat. Cheers to Harrah's in NOLA!! If you don't have a good time here at Harrah's Hotel & Casino....you're doing it wrong."
40,The beverage servers were rather attentive. There was no employee readily available to keep an eye on the slot machine that I was playing while I went to the restroom; so I had to wait a bit to go to the restroom.
50,"Almost everything was Great......We had a small problem with our room on one of the 3 days we were there but other that that I’d give it 5 stars. The staff and atmosphere was awesome. The food was delicious and we got to gamble, which I love. We’ll return because we left money in the casino lol......"
50,"Always visit Harrahs when in New Orleans. Convenient to the Freanch Quarter, good buffet, friendly staff. All of the table games that I like to play NIce to take a ride in the bicycle cabs from the Quarter."
50,"From the minute we checked in the service never stopped. Amazing staff and so friendly!! Robert the concierge, we couldn't have done New Orleans without you. The rooms are great, beautiful decor. Just a pleasnt experience all the way around!!! Centrally located as well. You can't go wrong by staying here!!!"
50,"Great stay in NOLA. The staff is wonderful and the hotel is beautiful!! Check in was a breeze and the ladies were very nice. Each time we walked out of the front lobby, the doorman was willing to assist us with information, regarding the city. The room were exceptionally clean and the beds were so comfy and fluffy. The hotel is located in the very heart of NOLA and most things are within walking distance or just a trolley ride away."
50,Really nice casino facility. Rooms were beautiful and large. Very nicely appointed. Desk staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and we were able to walk to the French quarter and French market with ease.
50,"We are local patrons and whenever we go to HARRAHS NEW ORLEANS,we always stay overnight or two nights..,more convenient than traveling back home... The atmosphere is wonderful and the Buffet is delicious as well as the other eateries on the premises....."
50,"Enjoyed my stay. Plush rooms and decor. Friendly staff. Wish there were drink stations inside the casino b/c it took a long time to get a soft drink but other than that, 5 stars. I would stay here again."
50,The hotel and staff were amazing. We had dinner at Ruth Chris which is located in the hotel lobby. It's located pretty close to everything and walking distance to the streetcar which will get you most places if you don't want to walk.
50,It was very nice and I will always stay at Harrahs casinos I like everythingI encountered on my visit to New Orleans I hope to return soon I like playing the slots at harrahs meeting different people and just enjoying myself
50,"Host Daylon Blind helped me reserve the best retirement getaway ever. Harrahs hotel is nice, clean, modern and right next to Harrahs Casino. We had a great time we ate at Mannings and the Buffet and the food was good. Hotel is next to Cafe Du Monde in the mall. Very nice once in a lifetime trip. Thanks again Daylon"
50,"Beautiful rooms, clean, smell good. Love location. Close to several restaurants and casino right across street. Nice view of river. Employees all welcome you when you walk in and leave. Kenneth is the best bell man."
40,"Beautiful town, nice casino, kinda dated hotel. The hotel is close enough to everything. Over all clean and comfortable. The casino is no smoking and within walking distance. The food is awesome, but, don't park valet, even if you are staying at the hotel and gambling. It's $42.00 a night."
50,"I had a great room with a fantastic view of the Mississippi River. Everything was on point, as usual. The hotel is immaculate and the staff is great. I travel solo most of the time and always feel safe and secure."
50,We had a great time! Brought in my family from out of town. They had fun as well. The venue is super clean and well maintained. The staff was courteous and friendly. The validated parking is a HUGE perk.
50,"When you are visiting New Orleans, parking can be a great inconvenience and expensive. Well if you enjoy gambling at least once a day then Harrah’s can be a life saver. Instead of paying for parking while we stayed there we just Gambled about an hour a day and parked free. Thank you so much Harrah’s!"
10,Stayed at Hotel for 3 nights and was the worst nightmare! Had a bunch (3 to 5) of kids in their twenties stay in the room next door. They used the room as a party room 3 straight nights playing loud music and yelling loudly. After the second night called security and the security did nothing. Had to take a sleeping pill to fall asleep. Third night talked to the front desk at 11pm and still nothing was done. Until 230am called security again and they send someone up to tell them to keep it down. The kids kept partying till 530am. Harrah's needs to have their staff better trained.
50,My trip to this casino was very interesting at the people were nice and I felt like I enjoyed myself while I was there and mini other benefits to being there helps me enjoy my time and would probably visit again
50,"I had a great time, money was flowing. Everthing was nice, only one thing was wrong and it was too cold. Everything was nice i liked the way they have bartenders set up when you press the button they arrived."
50,"Overall great. Spokesman casino of New Orleans I’d like to say. Rewards are great and more often than most casinos. Also, I believe it’s the closest casino to my residence, seeing how I actually live in Covington on the NorthShore"
50,Great team efficient service and friendly. Rooms were well kept and remained cleaned through visit will recommend and remember to visit harrahs again...Thanks for a awesome stay all women on front desk is the best
40,"We never stayed, just visit when in town. Decided to take a few family members to eat at the buffet, which was alright. Playing slots was fun, had to stop servers for drinks. Holiday weekend too busy. We plan to get full experience and stay at hotel when we return."
50,Harrah's is a very beautiful property with great restaurants and casino on site. Location is convenient to walking and close to trolley line. Many wonderful places to visit and sightseeing is reasonably priced.
50,"Friendly, curtious, neat great buffet, waitress was kind and overall I had a wonderful experience. I will be returning back soon and highly recommend this place for a vacation or just for dinner. Everything"
50,I was pleasantly surprised by the room's look and view advantage. I was basically expecting a run-of-the-mill room and boy was I surprised! Our room was one of the better appointed ones that we have stayed in. Even better than some of the higher rated hotels that we have stayed in.
40,Harrah's have a good selection of games and the food is great friendly staff great place for date night middle of everything Close to French quarter and steamboat rides and other restaurants the place to be
50,Hotel was close to the french quarter and to fine dining and casual restaurants. The staff was very accomodating and helpful. Dealers at the casino were very pleasant and friendly. we felt very secure inside and outside the casino premises.
50,Love this hotel & casino! It’s right in the middle of everything and very accessible to great restaurants and shopping. If you love New Orleans and the French Quarters it is absolutely one of my favorite places to stay and be pampered.
50,"I will be there in the near future. Hope to find what I want. All I need is a free room for staying to play, but I find no Porker slot machine like we have in Cherokee casino. Next time I will stay longer. It is okay when I was there on sept this year. Thanks"
50,I really enjoyed taking my most recent vacation.The casino experience was fun even though I didn't win it was still fun. I had fun talking to other's next to me when they would win and the entire atmosphere was nice.
50,Hotel was very nice and close to restaurants and bars. Loved smoke free casino. All Employees were very nice and professional. I would definitely stay there again on my next visit. We ate at Steakhouse and Ruth Chris and both were very good.
50,Casino staff was very friendly! The casino table games were not packed and was easy to locate. The beverage servers came around very often and the best part was the music that they played. I was having a good time and very cheap table games.
40,It was close to the airport room was very nice big bathroom cleaned everyday staff very helpful Near French quarters The only down side their wasn’t an outdoor pool Other than that very good place to stay in Nola
50,Clean rooms. Helpful stuff. Wonderful experience. I would absolutely recommend going back and I will be returning! This was my second trip to this location and it will not be my final trip here! Good luck everyone!
50,"The experience was great the hotel is in a spot where you can walk to everything. Shopping, gambling, boat rides, bourbon street, and different places to eat. Everything was at your finger tip. Excellent hotel!"
50,"Casino is smoke free, clean and inviting. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I always love gaming here. A must stop for a break from the heat when in NOLA and there is always great entertainment going on at the Filmore. Harrah's is impeccable. Love it here."
50,"I always enjoy spending some time at the casino. This one is a must do when I come to New Orleans. My friends and I really appreciated that it is now smoke free. There is a very large variety of slot machines, tables and the buffet is pretty good as well."

40,Nice safe clean casino. Outdoor smoking and gaming area was a bonus for both smokers and non smokers. Drinks were impossible to get. We ordered on slots and waited way too long for just a soda or water.
30,My son and I use our Labor Day vacation to visit NOLA. The first room we checked into had a cigarette smoke smell (non smoking hotel). But we were immediately given another room. Friendly staff. Rooms are clean. My host made our stay go well.
50,"Fun clean place with fun dealers! Dealers will pull for you to do good and will talk to you the entire time. The Masquerade is very nice and a super fun place to have music, alcohol, girls, and blackjack"
50,Very clean atmosphere and the staff was very nice. The staff brought my drinks when I requested and just the way I ordered them. The parking garage was close and we didn't have to walk a long way. And the most important thing is I won more money then what I came with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
40,I love playing on my card to get my free rooms i only had that one problem with the machine when i won but couldn't get paid and was told by a manager i couldn't take pictures or videos or i would be ask to leave
50,"I always enjoy staying at the Harrah's New Orleans property. Pleasant staff, nice rooms. Very convenient walking distance to the CBD, French Quarter and waterfront. I've probably stayed at this property 8 or 10 times and have never had a bad room or experience."
10,"Hotel was great, but stay was questionable. The workers are pretty rude and say things that sometimes you don’t understand what they want. There was a custodial workers that was mopping the floor at 5-6ish in the morning (9/3/19) and he hollered at me and said, “FLOOR!” I didn’t understand what he wanted from me, but in the end all he had to do is say, “...to avoid slipping, can you walk around the periphery...”."
50,"Harrah’s staff were friendly, helpful, and super nice. They’re also knowledgeable about New Orleans tourism industry and best places to go. Our room is really clean including the hotel surroundings. Highly recommended!"
10,"My check in experience was great. Ms. Lesley was helpful and caring regarding my family and our concerns. I decided to upgrade to a suite so we would be more comfortable. Unfortunately, the neighbors we had next door were horribly loud the entire week. Every day they were having loud parties, tons of people and playing music loudly. We believe we smelled MJ a couple times. We were not able to get any rest so we decidced to check out early due to the loud noise. During check out it was clear that Erica, was unphased by my concerns, did not care why we were checking out early, nor did she ask how did we enjoy the stay. People like her really give a nice hotel a bad name."
50,"You are greeted every time you go in and out of the hotel. The rooms are beautiful and clean. Beds are very comfortable. LOVE, LOVE THE FOOD at MANNINGS restaurant. The service is EXCELLENT. YOU WILL HAE A GREAT TIME!!!!"
50,Whoever does the hiring for desk clerks and other employees at Harrah's New Orleans is the best ever. Everyone at the hotel was super nice and friendly and smiled and spoke to us every time we walked thru the lobby. This is probably the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in and I cannot say enough about the staff. They all look like they are glad you are there and are happy to see you. They are very professional and can answer any questions about the area. I very highly recommend Harrah's if you are staying in New Orleans.
50,It’s was my friends 30 bday and we went to Saints game and Bourbon Street But I took her to the Casino since she had never been. One of my favorite casinos to visit. Had been nearly 11 years since I’d been there but still enjoyed my visit.
40,"Staff was great and very nice hotel, easy access to casino. Majority of casino hotels, provide complementary bottle water, which there was none. Last time I visit, there was actualy a few Fiji water, but would be charge $5.00 if got one, that a laughing matter!"
50,"This property is really nice. The location was very convenient. It is within walking distance of the Convention Center, the Mall., and Bourbon Street. The room accommodations were comfortable. There is easy access to the Casino through an underground, security guarded, smoke-free tunnel into a smoke-free Casino."
50,"Friendly, helpful, courteous service was what I always receive. This visit was no different. I welcome any opportunity to visit this property. my stay is always a wonderful experience. The rooms were excellent."
50,"Very spacious,courteous and professional. Rooms are very very clean.the staff, the area the sameness in which I feel when I was there.was amazing. The night skyline from the room was beautiful. You will come back!!!!"
50,"All was excellent . Great view, super rooms, very safe & close to Mall, French Quarter, & boats. Staff very personable & friendly. Ideal to combine business mtgs with transportation at the front door in minutes."
50,Great place to stay and play. Extremely clean and have so many different slots and video poker to choose from. Very clean and the hospitality is amazing. I will definitely go back often and i recommend This Casino and hotel
40,Great place with a lot to choose from. Very well kept up and clean and cool! Great gaming tables and great location. Love the atmosphere and restaurants. Will definitely return. Could use better rewards
50,"Nice hotel; lovely if you can get it comped along with a nice view. I gambled away about $500 dollars in 2 days. I understand that loss but its weird when you're told you've earned 3 comp dollars ( yeah yeah had my card in and the point calculation was a week later) Moving on, AC problems are sometimes worse that global warming....humidity is a blip."
50,The entire experience from beginning to end was very pleasurable and positive. We were pleased with all the staff and our accommodations. The only negative was the buffet on Sunday. A total waste of money.
40,"Harrah's hotel was top notch. The room was huge and had a bathroom with separate toilet, bathtub with additional shower and very clean throughout. We did have a problem with the mini refrigerator and it was promptly replaced. We did have an issue with our room keys not working one time. We would return in a moment. Very nice."
40,Overall a positive experience. They just need to upgrade some of the aged machines. The drink service could be a little quicker. The smoking section was nice and comfortable for my wife. The casino was in nice shape overall.
50,"Had a really great time gambling at the casino! Very clean, very friendly staff. A definite must visit! Sits in the heart of downtown, beautiful mall across the street! Also convenient to access by public transportation!"
50,Great service and great rooms would stay here again for sure Good Location for getting around. A lot of eating places and easy walking to the french quarter and the river walk. Spent 2 night at Harrah;s also ate at the Buffet it was very good
40,"Waterfront view, comfortable bed, have shower and bathtub. If you don’t want to leave, call room services order meals to your room. Harrah’s serve very good breakfast, lunch and dinner. Pho is very good on Friday and Sat. Night."
40,"New Orleans is a great place to visit, with the best restaurants in the world. Walking in French Quarter is relax feeling. You cannot find a better place to enjoy yourself. Harrahs is a great hotel with Vegas style casino. The room is very good, staffs are courteous, both in hotel and casino. With its location next to French Quarter, Harrahs is the best place to stay in New Orleans.."
50,"Great hotel, clean and relaxing. Casino and restaurants were awesome. Service was top shelf and staff were friendly and professional... highly recommended! I will definitely be going back in the near future!"
50,Stayed Harrahs New Orleans and the staff was exceptional! Very nice weekend getaway! Always something to do and great food. The staff at Harrahs goes the extra mile to make sure you always feel at home!
50,First time visiting New Orleans After a full day of walking around and taking in the sights. It was nice to sit back and gamble. The dealers were helpful and engaging. My game is 3 card. Both nights we visited the casino we were always able to find a seat.
30,Room was great! Perfect location by the waterfront I would stay there again for my next business trip. Wish there was more late night eateries to choose from and maybe more table games open for action in the evening.
50,"Had a fabulous stay at Harrahs New Orleans! The room was wonderful, spacious, clean, and many amenities. Housekeeping was always there to get you what you need. All employees were friendly and went out of their way to be there to answering any questions. Great vacation"
50,First time staying here in New Orleans and I will go back again. The hotel has great rooms and is a short walk to the casino. It is close the the French Quarter and several good restaurants. It is a smoke free hotel and casino which is nice.
30,"I was constantly reminded by several employees how ""lucky"" I was to be staying in their hotel. My room was clean but my view was straight into the hotel room at the LOEW's hotel next door. I am a Diamond member so I can only imagine what anyone less than a 7 stars member must receive. The steak house and the buffet were sub-par. The casino is nice but the Diamond Lounge is below average and the 4 drink minimum, per card, is ridiculous. The city is the attraction! This is based on the 3 trips I made there this year. Biloxi is the opposite of this. One is made to feel exremely comfortable. They are happy to see you."
50,Great stay in NOLA. I was very pleasantly surprised how clean and nice it was in this casino. The staff were super friendly and the entire place is very well maintained. I would recommend to anyone visiting the city.
50,"I took a trip to New Orleans to go to the Adam Lambert and Queen concert. The concert itself was fantastic. Harrah's is located very conveniently to both the Superdome and the Smoothie King center. I was thrilled with the friendliness of the reception desk and more thrilled when I got into my room. Fabulous. And of course I love smoke-free Casino at Harrah's. And I love the convenience of being able to order a drink at your slot machine. Maybe next time I can actually win., 🤑"
10,Security is lax in the garage. We had 2 tires punctured by what looks like an ice pick and the cameras apparently didn’t get a good look. I am now worried about my safety in garage. Would I get the same response if I had been attacked instead of my vehicle?
50,Love the atmosphere of the hotel and casino. Wonderful and knowledgeable hosts. Prompt check in service and excellent dining options. Location is also a plus. Booking with my slot host was easy and efficient.
50,"I hate those that pop in and pull out on table games. If you dont know how to play ask! Play for the whole table to win. Dealers will explain the game if you ask. when the table wins, dealers make tips."
40,"Overall, very nice. Very cordial staff. Superb location. Accesss to the front desk, elevator banks and the oncierge desk was very easy. We felt the public areas of the hotel were overly air conditioned. Thanks for the opportunity to comment."
50,"Great escape on cross country driving great service, room, the dinning was over the top, even won a little playing the tables and even made a new friend or two. Also central location and easy to walk to Canal Street and the French Quarter."
50,"In personal opinion this is my favorite location, I’ve visited a few times and I like the atmosphere and definitely enjoy the services provided. I will be going back and have a great time as it has been every visit."
40,"Harrah's New Orleans is an upbeat vibrant place. For an afternoon of entertainment with a huge selection of slots and tables, I came out a little ahead on the day which is always good. I would definitely go back for another visit."
50,"My room was nice and comfortable. It was clean. Housekeeping did a nice job. I will be back, hopefully soon. Lobby was polite and helpful as are the bell men. Only bad thing was that I lost money!!! LOL"
50,"Already reviewed and was posted under tishNOLA. Let me repeat, Harrah's hotel and casino always gives me a nice quick getaway. Enjoy the food, casino and entertainment. Harrah's is centrally located to shopping and nice restaurants. Not to mention, Ruth Chris is located in the hotel lobby. Hotel has nice updated rooms with city or river views. Management and employees are all very gracious, friendly an accomodating."
50,"Really enjoyed our time at Harrah’s. The casino was fabulous. The staff were all helpful, friendly, and courteous. Felt like we were in Vegas! If you visit New Orleans don’t miss your chance to see this casino."
50,"We had a regular king room on the 17th floor. It was spacious, updated, and very clean. We had a view of the river, so it was fun watching the boats go up and down the ""Mighty Mississippi""! Our room had a drip coffeemaker and a refrig. We ate at The Steakhouse inside Harrah's where Langston was our waiter and provided excellent service and made nice suggestions. My host, Aferkisha Lewis, was superb and treated my husband and I like royalty! She had a candy/nut gift basket in our room upon arrival, provided comps for our food, and made the effort to find me on the casino floor to visit- ""Kisha"" is a gem and a real asset to Harrah's!l All staff was friendly, from the front desk check-in staff to housekeeping to casino floor attendants to the buffet wait staff! We walked down to…"
50,We love New Orleans and we can’t think of a better place to stay then Harrahs Hotel! Located across the street from the Casino in walking to everything you ask for here. Great rooms and guest services was the “BEST”. “Every Anniversary Location”
50,"I do travel a lot, and this by far was one of the greatest experience from the time of check in to check out. My room overlooked the River, the staff was so warm and welcoming and helpful. This was my first time in NOLA and I can't wait to come back. I read all the reviews prior to my trip and was expecting a normal stay, but I have to say this was anything BUT normal..Love the property, location and again the warm, friendly staff. Great job Management.. See you soon."
50,"Everything was nice from the people to the establishment. I will definitely come again. I did not get a chance to eat there this time, but form my last visit the food was very delicious and there was wide variety of foods on the buffet."
50,We had a wonderful time. Our room was fantastic. The view was very nice. We will most definitely be back!!! Our time in New Orleans is always fun. We ate at some fabulous places this go around. Thanks for being awesome!!!!!
40,"The room was nice, big and comfortable with very nice view to the city. The service personnel are exceptionally helpful and friendly. The only minus is parking. Loading and unloading is a little crowded and you have to park your vehicle at the parking ramp around the corner of the hotel. Construction outside the parking ramp make it a little challenge to move around. Otherwise, my friends and I really enjoyed the hospitality and exceptional service from the staffs."
50,"The Casino is a great place to get out of the heat and away from Bourbon Street. Great environment , good food, and free drinks for playing. Most of the slots are new games i have never sen before. All the Table games are there for the playing."
30,casino was well air conditioned and clean the bathrooms were nice in a city where most are not. We played at the tables and the slot machines. easy to find a machine that was available.Waited a long time to get drinks that were free sometimes and not others. complicated ordering process.
50,We had an awesome weekend. The hotel was great except for the shower which took too long for the hot water to appear. We talked to the desk clerk and he said they were working on it which was repaired the next day. The casino was beautiful and we found the slots were loose. The treated us like royalty. We would definitely recommend this hotel and casino.
40,"Great location. Great room. Great gaming. Walking distance from the hotspots and easily entertained. Drinks are kinda slow though. Overall, it’s easy to recommend this place as there are lots of opportunities to keep yourself or your party engaged"
50,The front desk were friendly and very helpful. Always ready to help right away. The room service was outstanding. Room was very clean and the decor was beautiful. Casino and restaurants were great. Will start making this a yearly trip. We normally go to Las Vegas and was very happy with or trip to Harrah's New Orleans.
50,Harrahs is a nice hotel and casino in the heart of New Orleans. Staff is super nice. Walking distance to many attractions. Good food all over the place. Would highly recommend it to everyone. August was a little hot but we have been there other times of the year and it was't so warm.
50,"Didnt stay here, but enjoyed all the fun and excitement. Will love a stay hope my next visit would be as fun as my last . I would recommend this spot to anyone who's looking for fun and games. Everyone should visit"
30,What a wild city . A lot to see and do . As for the Casino we had a little room mishap but after some negotiation we finally got a room with 2 beds as I had booked 2 months prior. Rooms were nice and clean and casino was also nice . Everyone was very friendly!
50,"Very nice hotel. Conveniently located. A short distance to the French Quarter, a short distance to the airport, a short distance to the Garden District. Very close to the casino. I was able to have everything I wanted to see & do so close tho us"
50,A quick trip to NOLA had me in the casino for two days. Enjoyed my time. Everyone was nice and the place top notch. Drinks were good and plentiful. I came out breaking even on the small-bid card games. Will go back again soon.
50,Went to Harrah's just for the weekend 'lots of great action at the casino-lots of great food I and all around The casino-was clean and everyone made us feel welcome and safe stayed at Harrah's hotel was very clean and everyone was very nice can't wait to go back
50,"In New Orleans for the weekend and visited this Caesars property. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the visit. We wound up visiting Friday and Saturday. There is a wide variety of events to partake in. There were plenty of slots ... and they didn't seem to be too tight. People were winning on a regular basis ... so that is good! On Saturday--we gambled in the morning. We had our pick of the machines ... before it got too crowded. The Buffet was pretty good (lots of variety). It will fill you up--for sure--but there wasn't any one thing that knocked my socks off. I'll give it a 4/5. The price was on par with other Buffet's. It is cheaper than Bourbon Street. There is also a Starbucks, Burger Place and Sandwich shop. So if you don't want to break the bank ... there is…"
50,Enjoyed it me and my husband came for our anniversary and my birthday I didn’t stay at the hotel we only visit the casino so we really enjoyed ourselves thanks for having us we hope to be chosen for the survey
30,"Beautiful casino. Poor customer service, employees act like you're not there. Ordered drink from machine and took 30+ minutes to arrive. Used my players card to collect points and accrued $2.00 after 2 days of gambling. Checked to see for a discount on my card for the buffet and credit available says $0. For the money invested a nice dinner and a stack of scratch offs would have been better!"
50,"I would recommend Harrah's to anyone who wants to be close to the action. It's within walking distance to the French quarter and Bourbon St. The Aquarium and Riverwalk are right across the street. The casino is busy but the staff was friendly and attentive. You get free drinks if you play and the slots were pretty loose. If you like to gamble I recommend that you stay at the Harrah's hotel. Their rooms were clean and comfortable. Plus, I had a great view of the river."
50,"Always a great time here at Harrah’s New Orleans. Rooms are always clean, nice, and tidy, and the location is ideal. Can’t say enough about the hospitality and service here, some of the best I’ve encountered."
50,I had a relaxing time alone and Harrah's staff made me feel very welcome. I needed to get away from work and this was next idea and I'm glad I made the choice. I'll be seeing your facility frequently.
50,"Our room was on the 17th floor, nice city view. We could walk most places we wanted to visit. Room and hotel were very clean. Employees were friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend to anyone going to new Orleans."
30,"Beautiful casino. Poor customer service, employees act like you're not there. Ordered drink from machine and took 30+ minutes to arrive. Used my players card to collect points and accrued $2.00 after 2 days of gambling. Checked to see for a discount on my card for the buffet and credit available says $0. For the money invested a nice dinner and a stack of scratch offs would have been better!"
50,"I would recommend Harrah's to anyone who wants to be close to the action. It's within walking distance to the French quarter and Bourbon St. The Aquarium and Riverwalk are right across the street. The casino is busy but the staff was friendly and attentive. You get free drinks if you play and the slots were pretty loose. If you like to gamble I recommend that you stay at the Harrah's hotel. Their rooms were clean and comfortable. Plus, I had a great view of the river."
50,"Always a great time here at Harrah’s New Orleans. Rooms are always clean, nice, and tidy, and the location is ideal. Can’t say enough about the hospitality and service here, some of the best I’ve encountered."

50,My experience was amazing.The room was clean and we had a great view of the river.The staff was very pleasant and was very helpful in recommending places for us to go and the buffet had alot of local cuisine for us to try. I will definitely return
50,Very nice place to visit food is very good plus a lot to do in and around casino would tell anybody about this hotel and casino go parking cameras everywhere for safe worry free when you park and in casino
50,"Noise level was appropriate. Very clean facility. Waters came by frequently alto, it seemed most of the time my BFF's drink order wasn't processed, along with mine (different machines), but resolved quickly by staff."
50,Overall it was nice and met expectations Would reccomend to friends and family. Staff was friendly and was near all the areas we wanted to see. We loved that we had everything we needed at our fingertips.
40,"New Orleans is one of our favorite destinations because we love the food and love to gamble. The casino was always too cold for us, but we expect it now so we bring jackets. The buffet was a big fail, and I'm glad it was a comp. I remember when we really enjoyed it...now not so much. The hotel front desk staff were really friendly and efficient. The room was nice except the AC made a clicking noise that was annoying when trying to sleep. The worst part was housekeeping...they did not clean our room during our stay because they always arrived at 5pm just as we were about to shower and get ready for dinner. We had been out all day all days, but they never came before 5pm."
50,Good place to stay & play. Staff was friendly and drinks were easy to order from the machines with no issues. I highly recommend this NOLA to stay & play. Eating places were great I would suggest Manning's good place to watch sports and have nice meal served adjacent to casino/hotel.
50,"what a top notch crew you have every person i came in contact with were total proffesionals.helpful courteous and apleasure top be around. thank you all for making my trip a joy. oops forgot to include the housekeeping crew, they are great too.. having ruth chris steakhouse as part of hotel is great. having the tunnel direct to casino is a fantastic idea especially in bad weather. if you dont have great time in new orleans theres something wrong with you. we will continue to visit two or three times a year."
50,Loved the fact that the casino was smoke free! At the breakfast buffet the lady at the omelette station makes the greatest omelettes. She was there back in February when we came to New Orleans for a cruise and was there when we came back. Chose it this time over Las Vegas because of the smoke free casino. It’s so nice to go back to the room and not smell like an ashtray. New Orleans staff is always friendly.
50,Had a wonderful time at Harrah's New Orleans the room was comfortable it was clean great views comfortable beds the bathroom was huge love the bathtub for bubble bath and the staff would go over and above to help you out with anything that you needed
40,"We spent two nights here and found our room to be neat, clean and cool (seems like it’s always hot in New Orleans). The furnishings are modern but only having a single lavatory is inconvenient. The underground walkway to the casino is nice."
50,"Nice hotel and great staff. Stay there often due to invitation from Harrah's. Rooms are spacious with a great view. If you visit Harrah's Casino, get a Players card. The card will get you an invitation from Harrah's and most often provide you with a free stay at Harrah's hotel."
50,"Fun fun fun I love been there and didn't want to leave For sure I will be returning I love my room it was clean large and spacious. The buffet had a large selection of food plus there were other places to get at as well I really really enjoyed my shrimp poor boy sandwich. And I also enjoyed playing in the casino with my free 100 dollars comp credits. Thank you Harrah""s for the invite"
20,The hotel and room were nice but they did not honor the price they quoted price during booking. After several phone calls to various departments trying to straighten out the billing issue their final answer to the price increase was that the taxes went up.
50,Harold on the Texas Hold em table was so kind and enhanced my experience with his vibrant personality! I had a great time. will return! The drinks were really good as well. Wait staff was readily available to assist as well.
50,Harrahs was great everything was Great Every time I go it’s Great . The employees the hospitality the food the casinos the dealers GREAT GREAT GREAT ... I would recommend it to anyone young old big tall just bring them ALL
50,Everything was wonderful! Would recommend to everyone. Food was great. Entertainment was great. Loved the casino. A trip everyone should do at least once. Hotel was amazing and the room was beautiful. Will definitely be back soon!
50,It was an all around great experience.i had a great time.the people were awesome.the drinks were cold.i will be back soon as I can get there..it's my favorite casino by far. I love y'all thanks for the good time
10,"Place is filthy, customer service is horrible. Check in was 2 hours late, and we didn’t get Housekeeping in 2 days. We misplaced our keys and customer service told us they didn’t have our keys. After 6 frantic hours one of the valet employees let’s us know they have found our keys. Customer service ladie still denied they had our keys until the valet guy pulled them out of a drawer."
50,"We had a great time. The hotel is Beautiful, inside and out. The staff is friendly and helpful. We were happy and well relaxed. You must stay at Harrah's New Orleans. Thank you Harrah's for making this dream a reality."
50,The Lobby was very clean and organized and the staff was ready to assist me as soon as I walked in the door. My room was the cleanest I've ever stayed in and the bathroom was large with a shower and relaxing tub. I'd highly recommended staying at this hotel.
50,"Everything was wonderful and a great experience. The staff were courteous, professional and very helpful. One of my friends highly recommended this place and he was right in every aspect of my stay and trip."
50,"Stayed for 3 nights prior to a cruise, then 2 nights after. We were very impressed with this hotel, very clean and modern. with a very professional staff. I would definitely be booking my next room there in the future."
50,Parking was validated after 30 minutes of play. I don't know if it was a smoke free casino but I didn't see anyone smoking inside so I loved that. The drinks were quickly served. There was enough tables and slot machines so I wasn't crowded. Employees were friendly.
30,"The room was beautiful and the property itself was great. The check in process however was a nightmare. There were people just standing around waiting for their room. Check in was at 4:00 p.m., and by 5:00 p.m., we still didn't have our room. They said the rooms were still not ready. After a long day of traveling the last thing you want to do is wait in the lobby unable to change or get situated."
50,Harrah's of New Orleans is an excellent place to stay. The staff is very professional and friendly. The rooms are very clean and I had a very spacious bathroom. They are located within walking distance of restaurants and Bourbon Street.
50,It's our second time to stay at this location and have nothing negative to say about it! Location very convenient to great eating locations including a Ruth Chris Steak House in the lobby of the hotel.
50,The property is absolutely beautiful and great location to all famous attraction to(Bourbon Street and the French Quarters. You definitely will get your excercise in daily. We averaged around 11K - 15k steps daily. The food of course is always AWESOME. If there were attractions too far to walk; there was always the convenience of Uber. I tottally enjoyed being worrry-free of lovely limo service pick-up and drop-off at the airport. Customer service overally was excellen!!!
40,The casino is huge and has plenty of table games and machines. My only disappointment was the lack of opening more than one PaiGow table. My wife and I had to wait several hours to finally get a seat to play PaiGow.
50,Beautiful hotel right on the gulf had a very good view of the water the hotel was beautiful all the staff were nice and friendly this place is beautiful for a weekend getaway. Just need a few more restaurants
50,Had a great time with my friends at the nightclub then played the slots and won a nice little jackpot. Can’t wait to go back again. Next time we will try the buffet. Really nice layout and open floor plan feel. Smoke free.
10,"I made our reservations in April to stay at Harrahs in NOLA in August for two nights. I made them aware I was arriving late - 11:00 PM. When we arrived, we asked the desk if they had any water and was told they were out. When we arrived at our king bed non-smoking room, we discovered it was outfitted for a disabled guest. This is an issue because we were not informed beforehand and because the differences in the placement of some of the amenities, can be dangerous for those not used to these. When I finally got someone to answer the phone at the front desk, I requested another room. We went to the lobby and spoke with an extremely rude young woman. I again asked for water and was told that they had none but it was suggested that I could use room service or pay $6 for a…"
50,"We always have a wonderful time at HARRAH’S! There is no place like New Orleans. My host DANA YURATICH is amazing, could not ask for a better host. The staff at the hotel & casino are also helpful & attentive."
30,"The room was clean and the bed was soft ,I wish yall had moer movies channels the food was good but high on price the slots dont make me talk about that and whats up a about the trevel fiee y do you have play for two hours when it said that it was free while dat all I got to say oh did I forget I am not playing the slots no more if I ever come back down there bye"
50,"Awesome room, large variety of table and slot machines to play, excellent restaurants, convenient parking, and everything to do is in walking distance from Harrah's New Orleans. Recommend this property to anyone traveling to New Orleans."
50,very pleasant trip. loved the action in the poker room.. food was good. only issue was the service on the floor with drinks. At times we had to wait a while to get drinks but overall a very pleasant and entertaining weekend
40,"Decided to go gamble in New Orleans in August due to over 600 bucks in free play. To cut the trip short, we broke the trip into two parts, from Atlanta to Biloxi, and then Biloxi to New Orleans on August 13. We stayed in Biloxi for two nights at the Harrah's Gulf Coast. We arrived on Sunday evening August 11, 2019. We were told the suite was upgraded and it was fairly nice, but run down and antiquated in some areas. There was no true walk in shower and getting into the high sided bathtub was difficult and somewhat scary. We had virtually no free play in this casino but we got three buffet ticket.--not so good as the buffed is closed for lunch and breakfast on the weekdays. We valet parked the car, and went out on Monday night. When we got to our destination the car was…"
40,I went for the weekend and staff was very nice. If they seem me around they said happy birthday everytime. I would definitely go again. I really like that it was nice smoking since I don't smoke it was easier to breath
50,Room was beyond believe. Could not wait to take a shower in the walk in shower. And those that like baths you could have a party of about 20 in the tub it's huge. Slept like a baby pup with a full belly.
50,"Beautiful, exciting and clean fun! I love the smoke-free environment. My favorite games were open. I was along, but the people next to me were friendly. And I left with more than I came with. Win-Win!!"
50,"Rooms were very nice and the atmosphere in the Casino was great. Everything is walking distance from the Hotel/Resort, restaurants, shops, and Casino, as well as Bourbon Street. Our Bell Hop was great, went out of his way to help us and was extremely friendly, we even ran into him on Bourbon Street and he again went out of his way to be friendly and give up ideas of what to do while on Vacation."
40,"Friendly dealers and staff, good food and good drinks. Enjoyed our time gambling, had fun even tough we came out with no money!! LOL...We will be back if we get a break on the room price:)). It's a no smoking casino but they do have a small patio casino at the side."
50,Stayed 3 nights. Great hotel and great location. Fantastic room with view of the river. Would definitely Stay again. Can’t wait!!! Loved taking the streetcars right outside of the casino door. Up Canal and on to the French Market.
50,Just stayed at Harrah’s in New Orleans because we were going to a Queen concert. They treated us wonderful. As soon as we checked in I got a text with a name and phone number to call or text if we needed anything. The room was beautiful and staff were great too!
50,It was a wonderful experience and I will do it again. The services and property was clean and the staff was great. The host was very helpful in providing me with information regarding receipt of my travel confirmation. He emailed me and called me several times to make sure I received the requested information. I was able to make reservations at the Steakhouse for me and my daughter. Everything and all the staff were quick to answer questions regarding where to go to eat or places to see.
50,"Always a nice stay here at Harrahs... on top of it all I actually won some money! Acme Oyster house is a must try! The raw oysters are fresh and the charboiled oysters are the best, The fried catfish was a hit with my wife"

50,"We stayed for 3 nights and couldn't have asked for a better experience. The room was nice, clean, and roomy. There were plugs everywhere we wanted them and the internet was dependable. The staff was friendly and helpful. I have no complaints."
40,"Very nice hotel, but pricey. Not too far from from the French Quarter. A streetcar stop is over by the Hilton. No breakfast options at this hotel. It is connected to Harrah's Casino. Staff is very friendly. Two adjacent restaurants (Manning's and Grand Island) are to be avoided."
50,"Hotel was clean accommodations were good as well look forward to my next visit at the New Orleans Harrah's. The location of the hotel is perfect. Close to the riverwalk, as well as the riverwalk mall."
20,"No room was available. Horrible service, This was a second chance for the casino hotel and I regret making Harrah’s the highlight of my trip. I did not see any winners including myself and recommend Boomtown or another casino in Lake Charles."
50,If you are looking for a casino with plenty of options and provides a clean non-smoking environment it is tough to be Harrah's NOLA!! The only thing we need now for Louisiana lawmakers to get it together so we can have a sportsbook!
50,"I really enjoyed my time at Harrahs, there were lots of games and a very friendly and helpful staff, the drinks were good, and a nice assortment of food items to choose from, a very nice buffet and also a very nice steak house, a great atmosphere"
50,Paris is a great place to visit and spend money at the food is good the rooms are amazing in the customer service are amazing to the people are very nice and would love to continue going to Harrison win more money!!!
50,The property was great clean friendly people took time answer questions directionsparking good food was amazing I would recommendo all my friends and family looking to have a great time on vacation. Would visit again and again
40,"I was an invited guest of the casino to the hotel with certain amenities offered. Upon check in I was informed ""the rules have changed"" since I accepted the offer. Not one to be taken lightly I went to management and got things straightened out but the front desk staff was clueless as to how to help. They are not allowed or empowered to fix anything. Whatever info is on their computer is all they can do or offer no matter what documents you may have to show them.. Not very good service for a VIP invited guest. But eventually it all got fixed. It just took several frustrating hours to get it done."
30,"No $100 reimbursement from MYRTLE to NEW ORLEANS because: Didn't get receipt for cab BUT we showed bank statement online for date and cab fee - NOT GOOD ENOUGH! USED AIR MILES so that didn't qualify either! We were denied a crummy $100 to come all the way from South Carolina but because they have some legal small print, we were denied. That's how Caesars is going to treat their Diamond Players? That's PETTY AND MISLEADING. Our trip was otherwise wonderful thanks to all the friendly employees (except for the elder lady from V.I.P. Host services who was rude) who entertained and served us."
50,We were only there for a day. But we found the staff very helpful and the atmosphere was great. My boyfriend had a great time in the poker rooms while I enjoyed the slots. Definitely will be coming back when I get a chance to.
50,"Beautiful place!!! The staff courteous very personable, friendly informative and,helpful.The room was awesome very nice and,spacious with all the amenities providing us everything needed for a wonderful visit .A place of great grandeur but,at same time giving you the comfort of home !!!! K.Propst"
40,Nice casino and good place with good food and service. Excellent casino host Ms. Mao. She is very knowledgeable and go out of her way to assist customer. Blackjack table is the best to gamble. The slots are hit and miss.
50,"Beautifully appointed hotel, friendly and helpful staff. Had a fabulous time - it is centrally located, walking distance to two malls, the French Quarter, and the Paddlewheelers. Beds are so comfortable and the bathroom is huge! Unable to comment about the price as I was a guest of Harrah's"
50,Room was very nice with tub and shower. View was great for river and city. I did not experience any issue that were not addressed promptly. I would stay here again very soon. The housekeeping folks were awesome.
40,All employees were friendly and helpful. The room was clean but not outstanding. The indoor walk to the casino was long! The casino was not for winning. The buffet was so so. The inroom food sevice was excellent as was the food. We won't rush back. Our Harrahs in K C is by far better.
40,I wanted to stay at a Caesers reward place to gain points. In Vegas I could've stayed at Paris for $53 a night. Spent $168.00 for a night a Harrah's New Orleans. Hotel was not that nice for that price.
50,"Upon arrival, I was met by the Front Desk Manager and his professional, caring attitude set the stage for the entire stay. The hotel was great, a wonderful breakfast in the morning got the day started right and the hotel is clean, safe and couldn't be better! It was a good stay and I'm glad I chose Hampton Inn & Suites!"
40,"Did not stay there but did visit the casino several times during my stay in NOLA! The greeters were fine they were curtious & helpful, I even felt a fellow named Larry brought me luck!! The bar servwers were quick and friendly as well!"
50,Room was large and had a great view of river. Clean room and the staff was outstanding. My host was friendly and very helpful. She made the trip special. The hotel is pretty and clean. I would recommend to friends.
50,"We didnt stay there but I plan to one trip in the future. The buffet in my opinion was a bit pricey, the casinos closer to home we like $20 and up bit not over $35, they have seafood and Grade A steaks as well. No real deals like casinos close to home to come back. I love the city."
40,Stayed at the Lowe's Hotel. It was pleasant all but the mildew odor in some of the rooms. The staff was nice and very helpful and friendly. Harrah's casino was right across the street and convenient and very accommodating.
40,The casino was super clean! It did NOT smell like cigarette smoke!! Great music and DJ in the electronic roulette game area. Staff at the players card desk were super friendly and helpful! Lots of games to choose from!
30,When we checked in the clerk would not even check to see if we could have rooms near our friends. There were pipes clanging in our room all night. We put thousands through the slot machines and did not get any buffet or food offers. We asked to be comped and the floor employees had no idea what we were asking about
40,I had a very good time. A Memory. For life . Would like to say everyone needs a experience like this . The rooms were very clean . Customer service was excactly on point . Won a lot of money from the casino
50,"Harrahs New Orleans is a very clean hotel with an extremely professional staff. I was quite pleased with my stay and the service I received. The location was great because I was near all attractions (i.e. casino, shopping, restaurants)."
40,"love this hotel, been to many of ceasers hotels and this ranks on top. even nicer than vegas. the only complaint i have is that they have no pool. gym is great. conveniently located near the french quarter."
50,"Wonderful and attentive staff! Also, great room. Slots were not too tight, so you could enjoy your time on the casino floor. Plenty of choices to play and slots included some with reasonable max bets."
50,"I had a god time playing so many different slots. Only downsize was getting out of the parking lot - even though I had my validation, Instructions pretty much non-existant and the help person responding was no help at all. This is not my first time with this problem."
50,Staff was friendly and attentive to your needs. Enjoyed the slots in the casino. Great location next to the river walk and shops. Would definitely comeback and stay here again. Great drinks at the Masquerade club.
50,I would have liked more time to experience everything the hotel had to offer. The rooms & bathrooms were very spacious. The hotel was in a great location & convenient to everything. Buffet had great selections for brunch but a bit pricey.
50,"i had a marvelous time at the New Orleans Harrahs Casino. The great friendly atmosphere combined with the professinal, knowlegeable, caring but yet friendly staff made a pleasant experience. I would for sure recommend this Casino to all my friends"
50,The room I rented was great with a good view. I could see the Mississippi River from my window. The food was very tasty. I love going to New Orleans and love going on the historical tours. I promise myself that I will visit New Orleans twice a year.
50,Love Harrah’s everything about it is amazing. Nothing better than it. The buffet is amazing. The staff is friendly. The hotel rooms are out of this world. There is no other casino that is like this one
50,"So we didn't stay on the property. We only visited twice while there. This casino is vibrant, clean, and has an exciting buzz about it. The craps tables have 10x odds and the dealers are mostly friendly and fun. Since that's all I play, that's all I have feedback about, but it is a grand time nonetheless. The girls working the cashier's cage were unbelievably friendly."
50,We really enjoyed ourselves and as we always do and we drinked dance and gambled ..... .and it was nothing but fun times even though we didn't win any money playing blackjack we still managed to have so much fun
40,The casino has a very large selection of table games and slots. The property is very clean and updated. Would definitely return again when I am in the area. Centrally located to many other attractions.
50,Great food. Great fun great service I was attending the 610 stompers tryouts and we decided to eat dinner. The service I received from Shawn Johnson was great. She fast caring a great listener and was happy she was my server
50,"Convenient location. Great drinks while gambling. Prompt, courteous service. Clean facilities. Great music. Friendly staff. Anniversary getaway that we I'll likely never forget. We had fun. No complaints!!!"
50,"The rooms are clean with very comfortable beds. Of course, the food is AMAZING! A great NON-SMOKING casino!! The only thing that could be improved is the lighting in the bathrooms. We've been visiting NOLA for years, as it is one of our favorite Harrah's Properties!"
50,Everything was excellent! The staff was nice but extremely nice!~ and it was clean and a whistle! I liked the casino... even though i didn't win! Better luck for me next time! And the machines are updated
50,Love that getting a drink while at slot machine was as easy as pushing a button. Service was quick. We ate at the night buffet and found it to have a wide range of food and excellent service. Bring a sweater or wrap because the casino was cold. Much rather it be cold than too hot though.
40,"We were only visiting the casino so I can't rate the hotel. However, the casino was fantastic. There were many, many games to play. The location was great also. Very close to many attractions. The only complaint that I would have is that some of the machines had issues and it took quite a while for someone to show up to fix them, sometimes not at all. I'm not sure if it was a network issue or what. Other than that, it was great!!"
50,"All dealers I had were great. They have all the tables and slots you need. I love the electronic craps table, that I call ""The Bubble"" Nice that it is smoke free. They layout if very nice too with the location of it being close to many of the areas of the city we would visit."
50,"The property and service at the Casino is great. Parking is free as long as you play for 30 minutes or more. If you’re looking to win a lot of money, take up a new hobby. All in all I had a great time, met nice people and enjoyed the food."

50,"Great hotel with friendly staff. Great location, comfortable beds, pillows, and sheets. Huge bathtubs and everything was sparkling clean. The hotel is not connected to the casino, but is directly across the street."
50,The suite was very nice! Cleaning service was efficient also. The front desk staff was very friendly and provided excellent customer service in every interaction. I would highly recommend this hotel for family getaways!
50,Casino was Clean. Staff was extremely friendly. One of a kind customer service! Buffet was delicious. Highly recommend a trip to Harrah's NOLA! You won't be disappointed. Whole family loved our visit.
50,Had a great time people were very very friendly and will always come back. And the food was pretty good too I don't know why choice of restaurants to choose from. Only thing that I didn't like I had to wait a long time to get service at the slot machines
50,"This is a great place to stay! The beds are very comfortable and there is plenty of room in your hotel room. It was immaculate. The employees are super friendly. The parking is convenient. As long as you gamble for a half an hour each day, you do not need to worry about paying for parking."
30,Unfriendly concierge. Bathrooms need a thorough scrubbing. Bedding needs replacing. I recommend choosing one of the upscale chain hotels nearby. All are walking distance to the French Quarter and Riverwalk.
50,We stayed 3 nights at the hotel. The room was 1113 with a view of the city. The room was a good size and had a sofa with a large ottoman. The hotel was in a great location near the Spanish Plaza on the river. The French Quarter is within walking distance. The casino is accessible without having to walk outside. The Fulton street next to the hotel is a nice addition for dining. We were able to earn free parking for all 3 days with relative ease. We would definitely stay here again.
50,"Great service and great location, wonderful hotel, The hotel is close to the street car stop and is right across the street from the casino. The hotel is also connected to several restaurants and bars and the French Quarter restaurants are only a 5 min street car ride away."
50,The location is great and transportation is easy to access. Staff is helpful and work hard to make sure you are happy. Property is clean in the hotel and also the casino. Highly recommend. We will stay again!
30,For our 45th Wedding Anniversary I ordered wine to be in our room when we arrived. Was not delivered and had to call services to find out why it was not there. Not happy with a $96 room charge for the wine.

40,Great place yo stay...Customer service 💯 good and rooms are very nice and clean! I will most definitely recommend to anyone who visits New Orleans with great price. I can not express how much we really enjoyed.
40,The casino is very clean and welcoming with very modern rooms. It has a great location with a short walking distance to the French quarter and other attractions within the city. The hop on hop off bus stops right across the street from the hotel.
20,Dirty towels stained with make up. Reported it immediately to assistant GM who did nothing. Remote for tv missing. Not impressed with this casino hotel . I expected better from Ceaser’s property located in New Orleans.

50,I like my room location it's on 8th floor at Caesars Hotel casino in tower and restaurants was great we did not win anything or get a play we did have breakfast comps breakfast which was delicious would like stay again
50,"Wonderful hotel, My only wish is that they had a pool and casual dining/fast grab foods in the hotel. It is a pain to go to the casino for a sandwich. Overall, the hotel is very clean and quiet. This was our second stay and would do it again."
50,"An excellent experience there. Very nice rooms and excellent service. Rained put a damper on things and made getting around a little more complicated. Still, I’ll do it again next year! The slot machines were fine! Never the less I will do it all over again. Never won before and finally did a little anyway! Thanks for a terrific time!!!❤️ all over again"
50,"Awesome! Casino, club, food etc... A great time and great hospitality! I was on a girls trip with my sisters and cousin And we all agree that Harrahs was by far one of the top hotels to stay/visit in NOLA!"
10,"the room was dirty , the staff was not friendly at all... the headboard had oil stains on it and crayon stains all over headboard, Dirt on top of lamp and behind the night stand. Not at all what I recieved at other Harrahs ( they sell you the water for $6.00 a small bottle, wow )"
50,Opted out of housekeeping for Reward Credits..but we were able to get everything we needed Walking distance to Convention Center. and Bourbon Street. Casino was very nice and convenient to get to. I'm ready to visit again. Loved it.
50,"The rooms are large and the bathroom is wonderful with a large bathtub, separate shower and separate room for toilet. The employees are very helpful and always greet you with a smile. I didn't win much money but I enjoyed the Casino. The Casino has a nice Buffet and a couple of places where you can get quick food to go."

50,Our room was exceptional. Very clean . The mattress was extremely good. The room had lots of amenities. The girl who cleaned our room did an exceptional job. We ate in the buffet one night and the food selection was outstanding and very good.
40,"We stayed at a hotel in the French Quarter but the casino is in a perfect location,... only a few short blocks away. The casino staff and dealers were very nice.. Smoking was not allowed inside but the air conditioned smoking patio is a nice touch. I was shocked to discover that drinks were free when gambling. I thought that only happened in Vegas and AC. I'll be back on my next visit to this great city!"
50,"Room was lovely. Large room with a great view of the river. Bathroom was large with a separate toilet room, which made it nice as I was travelling with a friend. Beds were comfy. Haven't slept that well in a long time. Housekeeping was timely bringing up extra towels, etc. Great experience. Casino was good. Just a short walk through the tunnel. My friend likes to play Let it Ride poker and there was a $5.00 table. We had a blast playing that game. Slots and video poker were good too. Hotel location was very near the French Quarter. Easy for sightseeing. We took the city tour that was suggested by the concierge. Southern Style, I believe, very informative. The air conditioned bus helped, since it was so HOT. Great stay!"
50,"Queen room with river view. Pleasant and quiet. Great hotel!! Staff is all friendly. Great casino with friendly people. Third or fourth time staying here and was not disappointed about anything!! Outlet mall within walking distance as are many attractions. The Trolly stops adjacent to the casino. My ""go to"" hotel in New Orleans!"
50,"Had the pleasure of neing at harrahs,new orleans, hreat buffet and the palm room AKA tge diamond club is excellent our waiter pedro is top notch professional and courteous , all the staff in the palm room including the manager Mr Greg was very accomadating and treated us very professional and courteous, Thank you Harrahs for top notch customer appreciation, we will be back very soon"
50,"From the scenery all the way to customer service, everything was amazing. Definitely felt as if I was a vip member or some sort of important being. A night for the books if you ask me, my girlfriend had a wonderful experience also."
50,Overall despite the rude and disrespectful waitress. Harrah's is a very wonderful place to have a really nice time. Even though one person's lack of people skills can be a turn off Harrah's is a place to be . O personally choose not to be for awhile.
50,Beautiful room decor. Comfortable beds. Nice lighting. Excellent black our curtains. I loved the view of the river from my room. I would recommend this hotel for any stay. Very conveniently located near everything.
50,I wish I could have gotten the gift but we made it to late. I really enjoyed myself and will be back. Only thing I had a problem with is the drink servers are very slow. I order and moved down to machines and they still never came
50,"Harrah’s was a very nice hotel to stay at in New Orleans, our suite was very beautiful and cleaned. The Staff was outstanding and very helpful. I loved the Casino very clean with helpful staff! We will return there again sometime this year."
40,Over all very good service! It’s always a exciting place to go for a fun filled weekend! If you are looking for a good time then you need to go to Harrah’s of New Orleans. I can’t wait to go back and have fun again soon!
50,"Bed was comfortable, bathroom was small and crowded for 2 people but we managed. 25th floor so we had a good view of both the river and downtown. If we return this Hotel will be on the top of the list"
50,Our (myself and husband) stay at the hotel was was extremely beautiful and we would refer anyone and everyone to this hotel. Also the limousine drivers that picked us up and took us back to the airport was absolutely extremely kind.
50,"The casino is large and has many machines. When we go to casinos we like to play slots and eat at the buffet,but I think Harrah's buffet is to expensive, that's why we don't go to often. I do like that we can park in the garage and not have to get out in the weather."
50,Very positive experience! The staff was very courteous & helpful. The room was extremely clean and comfortable. I plan to visit again in the future. The food purchased from the casino vendors was very fresh and tasty. The shops in the casino were very quaint and affordable.
50,the Food in the steakhouse was outstanding. Waitress was extremely helpful with deciding what to choose. Service was very good. Would go back and dine here again and recommend to anyone traveling to New Orleans and Harrahs.
40,"I enjoyed my stay at The Hilton! The food was great at the restaurant in Harrah's . I was not familiar with the machines...I was not able to get funds off my credit card because of my temporary license, but I did have the picture ID to go with it??"
50,Excellent Location to things you want to do in New Orleans. Riverfront and Bourbon street and French Quarter. Trolleys always running right at the site. Must see and do if not taking small children with you or have someone to watch them while giving the Casino a swing.
50,"Nice large room everything was great. The room was spotless, and everyone at the customer service desk was extremely friendly. One of my favorite places to stay in New Orleans. Love the concierge app that is available"
50,Had a great time. Staff was great and handled my needs above expectations. Would definitely go back extremely pisitive. Buffet was great the only thing i wish they would change is get RID of PEPSI priducts and bring coca cola in.
50,We made an impromptu trip to new Orleans for my husband's 38th birthday. It was an awesome experience from the Casino to the riverboat ride to walking thru the French quarter. Can't wait until our next visit.
50,"Room was very nice, clean, nice view, friendly staff. Very polite, very helpful with restaurants and things to do. All employees were respectful and eager to make sure we had a wonderful experience. We felt like we were at home."
50,All employees I encountered were friendly. I did not win but I enjoyed the casino. The setup is a little confusing and it it easy to get lost in there but they have a variety of games for everyone. I would go again.
50,Everything was GREAT! Would definitely recommend this property to anyone planning to visit New Orleans. The location is central to everything and the service was top notch. We will surely return!!!!!!
50,"Room was cozy and comfortable. Room service was excellent! The casino is smoke free and thank goodness for this, it made our trip very fun and pleasant. I highly recommend this destination for anyone wanting to have a fun time with a good experience and great food!"
30,"I stayed in this particular hotel from August 07-10th, 2019. The check in process was smooth. Asked about an upgrade, the rates were reasonable however i stayed with the river view room on the 24th floor. Room was clean (except the coffee table, it was a little dirty but we didn't eat in the room so it wasn't a big deal). Room was very spacious and amenities were some of the best i have seen (i travel very often and this was by far very nice). Unfortunately for me, on Friday, August 9th, 2019, after a long day, I went to my room to find my door open (the little metal latch was holding the door open) and the house keeping sign was still lit. I took a picture. With reservations, i slowly pushed the door open to find a clean room, indicating that someone in deed did come in the…"
50,"Myself and some friends made a trip to the casino while visiting New Orleans, we had a ton of fun and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend a stop there even if you are not staying at the hotel."
50,"This is a very nice hotel. clean comfortable, the employees provide wonderful customer service and the price was extremely good for that city. The location is good for touring the city and shopping either in outlet or regular stores."
50,beautiful hotel and casino with lots of action! casino was cold as h--- so bring something warm to wear inside. Dealers were first rate. Looking forward to next adventure. Just a craps player at heart. Wes
50,"I loved my experience here. The location was great. The people were great. The food wad was delicious. I won a little money while I was there. I will return very soon. Oh did I mention, beads, beads, beads, and more beads."
50,This was the nicest room I have ever had the privilege to stay in. I thoroughly enjoyed the vast selection of food in the buffet and even tried things I had never experienced. The attendants were delightful.
40,"The staff were extremely polite and willing to assist on any issue. The location could not be better for visiting the local area. Within walking distance to the French Quarter, Riverwalk Shopping, and Cruise Port. I lowered the rating due the poor quality of Keno machines lower payout. The buffet was was good but I felt it was over priced."
50,"The Service was subperb. The rooms were spotless. Employees were professional, caring, courteous and friendly. Ouer stay at this location was nothing but good. Would recommend to everyone traveiling to NOLA to stay at this facility!!!"
50,The room was great. We were within walking distance of the French Quarter and the restaurants. The casino was another sort of entertainment. When it was to hot to be outside it was there.The table games with minimum of $25 was just to high. The house is going to get all your money anyway why not let you play longer and enjoy yourself. I didn't play when it was this high.
50,"The service I experienced was great very polite My room was the Bomb"" The view you couldn't ask for more. The location & amenities was very good Overall I liked everything about my stay have nothing bad."
50,"Well we stayed at our timeshare, this was our first time ever in New Orleans and always like to visit the casinos resorts, and yours was awesome. If we ever go back to New Orleans, I won’t miss going back to your casino. Thank you"
50,I only visited the casino for two days while staying in NOLA so I cannot attest to the condition of the hotel or other areas itself. The customer service and cleanliness of the casino was top notch. I even won!
50,"Went for the weekend. Had a great time. We stayed in the casino almost 24/7. If you have never stayed at this hotel. It’s beautiful, very clean and modern. The suits are amazing and have more room in them than my house does!"
50,"Our stay was totally last minute! We expected a tiny room next to the ice machine! WRONG!! Our room was amazing, clean, smelled fresh and truly made US smile when we entered! Friendly staff ! Welcoming!"
50,Great place to go and have fun. Service was great. Everything was really clean. All the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful they answered all off our questions we luved that you could order drinks from the machines
50,"This is one of my favorite Harrah's locations. It is considered non-smoking, but there is an outside, fenced, covered balcony area that provides a good supply of slot machines and other gaming. That's where smokers hang out. The buffet, although somewhat pricey, is wonderful. The range of gaming is good. There are typical slot machines throughout with choices for chances, types of games, and choices in denominations to play. It is conveniently located."
20,"A nice room. Location was easy to find but parking is a hassle. A very comfortable,clean bed. Clean, nicely stocked bathroom. Nice large screen TV. Employees at the hotel are friendly and knowledgeable. Concierge Robert was absolutely great."

50,It was fun and we won a little money. My boyfriend does not like casinos and he enjoyed himself as well. I will consider staying at the hotel my next trip for the location. It is right by the mall and not far from the French quarter
40,"I highly recommend Harrah's New Orleans! It located in the center of it all, entertainment and restaurants. Any thin you want to do is within walking distance. I love having the ACME Seafood Restaurant right there inside the casino!"
50,"3rd stay at this Harrah's New Orleans. Would not stay anywhere else in New Orleans. Great location overlooking the mighty Mississippi River .Excellent and breathtaking view from room.Rooms very neat clean and updated. All staff friendly,courteous and helpful.Casino great..did pretty well. Hotel/Casino close to wonderful sights stores Bourbon St lots of live music Food fabulous esp shrimp eteaufe and po boys. Fun exciting. So much to see and do."
50,We drove down from Chattanooga just for the day. We were on the mood for fresh seafood and some fun on the games. As always the seafood buffet did not disappoint. The selection was plentiful and the quality was five star.
40,"The hotel rooms are very large and have good views. It is centrally located in the heart of all the things to do in New Orleans. The hotel staff is very friendly. The casino staff are a little less friendly and don't like to give directions. The casino is clean and there is no smoking inside the building. The outside smoking area does have slot machines and some gaming tables, but is dirty and most machines aren't working. All in all it isn't too bad."
50,Beautiful room and helpful valet and front desk staff. I always enjoy visiting New Orleans and this hotel. The Steakhouse in the casino also has excellent food and a $39 menu at the bar. I will continue going back there.
50,"Hotel isy favorite place to stay, everything you need in a central location... And the Steakhouse is amazing... Best crab cakes in the city of New Orleans!! Hotel check in staff is super friendly and accomadating that's why we stay here at least once a month!! And we live within 50 miles of the property!!"
50,The room that we had at Harrah's New Orleans was beautiful. We was so delighted with our room that we shared a picture of the room with family. We cant wait to have another leisure trip in New Orleans.
50,Me and husband had ALOT of Fun playing games!! Hotel was an awesome experience as well! Staff was ALWAYS Super Friendly!!! Came back 11 days after our first time and will be back again SOON!! Thanks Harrahs @ Nola
50,"The property was extremely clean and very relaxing. Food was great, and affordable. This was a perfect place to relax and unwind from the everyday norms. If you're looking for comfort and being considered a VIP"
50,was top notch very polite and helpful.would recommend as a good place to stay and travel the attractions are a plus to experience and would suggest offering some sort of free play at the casino club card when signing up.
50,A very nice gaming experience in s smoke free area. The facility has outdoor accommodations for smokers where they can continue playing slot machines. The live band showing and playing was a pleasant surprise and made the experience more enjoyable. I plan to return soon.
50,nice service.nice people. nice games.everything were excellantn here.i want to come back with my friends and family again and again in harahs new orleans.i likethe new games here. nice free drinks and waiters r nicely behaved.
40,Great experience-Friendly Staff at New Orleans location-loved the fact that you can order from machines and have delivered to you-had bad experience when person next to me spilled her drink all over the machine and floor-no one ever came over to clean the machine or floor while I was there-no place to put empty drinks either-otherwise very pleasant experience
50,Had a wonderful time at Harrahs. I even ran into family members while at Harrahs. Wonderful and friend staff. Food and drink a where absolutely wonderful. I every won a couple of times on the slot machines.
50,A very welcoming casino. Lively and entertaining atmosphere both inside as and outside of the casino. Excellent dining experiences with a nice variety of venues. Rooms are very nice with easy access to the surrounding areas including French Quarter and Bourbon Street.
40,Bachelors party weekend had a blast! Went with a group of friends had some drinks and a lot a fun! Casino was located in the heart of the city. Beautiful place beautiful women! Will definitely be back soon only this time to win some money!
50,Harrah’s is a world class casino. It hold its own against the best in the country. The buffet is excellent especially on Friday/ Saturday when they have seafood night. The side restaurants also have some quick pickup meals . Strange but the food there is sometimes better then there counterparts outside the casino. The hotel is nice and convenient play first if you get in the bed first your liable to fall asleep. Also they have a great second line show running in the casino itself and the background music is nice
40,Didn't stay in a room this time. I have stayed in a suite clean and very nice! Hotel has great customer service! I would recommend anyone to stay here beautiful view and right downtown. Food was good also in the Harrah didn't have Crab legs but they did have Blue crabs
50,"Did not stay at the hotel, but the casino has variety of machines and card games, with a great night life!!! Love the ice bar!!! Several options for great food, great location. Would definitely come back again."
50,"I had a two room suite. The room was great. It was a little worn but everything functioned properly. The staff was helpful and courteous. Room service was fast and hot. The valet service was helpful, fast given the circumstances."
40,"Pleasant customer service and gambling experience. Non Smoking. My only issue was being denied a reshuffle as the only player at my initial sitting at a black jack table. Had I joined a game in progress or joined with other players, I'd have never made the request. But to be denied a reshuffle to start a session was rather petty customer service in my opinion. Casino's are supposed to be in the gambling busy, but if they prefer customers drive back home, so be it. I should have left."
50,"Great casino , love the perks of being a member already. Great casino, the people working on the floor are great and is nice help , if you have any questions one of the workers standing in the floor will give you the best and fastest assistance with whatever your needs are."
50,"When we go out of town and it’s just going to be “us girls”, I feel safer staying at Harrah’s compared to anywhere else. The staff is excellent, the rooms are great and it’s easy to get to and from anywhere you want to go."
40,"We stopped into NOLA for one night and decided to go to Harrahs and press our luck. Parking is $30 but you can get a players card and if you play enough they will validate the parking. However, good luck at the Rewards desk. Those folks are rude and very unhelpful. Good variety of slots and I absolutely love, love, love the non smoking casino. They have a great atmosphere with music and a mini parade throughout the casino. Located right off Canal street so you an literally walk out and be on Canal street. We enjoyed our stop...can't say we were winners but had a good time."
50,"Great atmosphere, tables, and staff. Waitresses service in the casino floor were very attentive, efficient and fast when providing a drink services. The facilities at Harrah’s were very clean. Recommend for a weekend getaway."
40,"Average to great trip, looking forward to coming back to NOLA, wish Harrah's would do away with all the video games and have more Dealers rather than virtual dealers, overall good experience, will definitely be back"
50,Harrahs was a great place to have fun and enjoy the overall atmosphere with family and friends. The lobby was beautiful and the food was great. My husband and I enjoyed this brief getaway and enjoyed the machines at the Casino
40,I visited family and friends! Took long time to get drinks delivered! Enjoyed buffet although bit pricey! I will return in October if all is well! Please send me coupons special offers so it will make trip less costly! Thanks
50,We were placed in an upgraded corner suite on a high floor with great views. WE were able to check in early which was nice as we arrived at noon. .The front desk knew my room preferences and were prepared for our arrival.
50,All the rooms we have ever stayed are top notch. No complaints at all. Love the spaciousness of the bathrooms. Shower water pressure was excellent. Makes us relaxed like we are in the lap of luxury. Beds are very comfortable as it always seems we sleep late when we go there because we get very good rest.
50,"Me and my family stayed at Harrah’s New Orleans and the stay was awesome, everything was so perfect and the people there were absolutely amazing. I can’t wait to go back and stay at Harrah’s New Orleans !!!!!"
50,"Absolutely love staying at this hotel! The front desk and valet staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The location is perfect for getting to see New Orleans. The hotel is located across the street from the casino, close to the convention center & Fulton St restaurants, and just a short walk to the French Qtr, Jackson Square, the Superdome, etc. The rooms are clean, large, and well-maintained. Liked having the added security to need your room key to access the floor buttons on the elevator. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious (with a separate room for the toilet), and the city and river views are amazing. Also convenient to all forms of public transportation. Great place to stay when visiting New Orleans!!!"
30,"The hotel is beautiful. The front desk personnel were great, easy check in and easy check out. I have stayed before and never had any issues but this time housekeeping was not very good. I had to notify them twice on our 2nd day there to get the room serviced. We were without towels and other amenities the whole day until 7:00 pm that evening. And for the price we paid that should never be an issue. But other than that the stay was good since the hotel is within walking distance to the streetcars and to other locations nearby."
50,"Other than a great casino, it is the best place to stay in New Orleans for fun with friends; right in the middle of town - bars, shops, restaurants, activities such as DDay Museum, riverboat rides and every thing was in walking distance"
50,"Loved the hotel, comfortable beds and spacious rooms. Excellent location, close to canal and the French quarter. People and staff are friendly. We’ll come back! Large casino with a variety of tables and slots."
50,"Excellent Service, RoomService, Free Meal Voucher for Multiple Restaurants, 40$ cash toward My Flight back to Atlanta Ga. Had a Free Ride to BoomTown Two Tickets to Basketball Game between Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptor at the Mercedes Benz Stadium."
40,"The hotel is beautiful. The staff is welcoming and accommodating! Very convenient to Riverwalk and the convention center. Short walk to Bourbon Street. Great amenities in the room, even a doorbell, separate shower and garden tub, private room toilet. Only drawback that kept me from saying excellent is there is no microwave in the room, nor is there one available for guests. Also the walls are thin! I could hear the guy next door's whole conversation. But I would stay there again. Just bring snacks that don't require warming."
30,I was extremely disappointed that there was no pool and/or spa. Harrah's did advise we could go to another hotel and use their pool!! Plus the convenience/gift shop was outside of the hotel making it difficult if one ran out of something. The did have a Ruth Chris restaurant attached but it is not with the hotel. Was disappointed with this property and I have stayed at many of the Harrah's/Caesar hotels.
50,This is a Good Energy Casino! Buffet was fairly priced for the selection. Dealers were friendly. Must at least walk through and get a break from the heat! I will be back next year for my yearly NOLA experience. It’s a 10 minute walk to Bourbon St as well!
50,"Very nice casino. Large and spacious. Good location in (or very near) the French quarter. Walking distance to lots of activities. Attentive servers. Nice, clean bathrooms. Free drinks for ever 20 minutes of play."
50,We had a business meeting in New Orleans and were lucky enough to get our stay at Harrah’s in New Orleans! It was a great stay!! Our room was amazing and the service was first class!! We look forward to our next visit!! Donna
50,We brought ten people to New Orleans and Harrah's was amazing at accommodating such a large group. The rooms are big and beautiful with a view and the casino is a ton of fun. The people are so helpful and there is a lot to do within walking distance. They also have pedicabs that are super affordable for those who do not want to walk far. The restaurants inside the casino are also amazing.
50,"My experience was excellent, and I would definitely be returning to Harrah's New Orleans. The service was exceptional and the dealer were very engaging and helpful. I did not win any money, but overall I had a great experience."
50,"First class, I so enjoyed myself. I was extremely surprised to receive the quality of my trip compared to my gisit in New Jersey. I highly recommend this hotel. Though, I didn't win any thing and kept losing my card I had a great time. The drinks were yummy too."

50,Rooms was great. Steak house was warming and the food was wonderful. I had a great time on my vacation. Can't wait to visit again soon. Had a ball. I enjoyed the buffet and the burger place inside the casino.
50,"Excellent French Quarter accommodations!!! Everything was within walking distance of the hotel; Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc. The sites and sounds, food and laissez faire was memorably exceptional! A must stay location."
40,"As a local New Orleanian I frequent the city often. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel but the casino buffet was some of the worst food I have ever experienced in this city renowned for its food. It miss represents our cuisine so avoid it, spend the 30 bucks a person elsewhere, you’ll thank me."
50,Our experience with Harrah's New Orleans was wonderful. Staff very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed Friday night music review. Restaurants were clean and good. Looking forward to going back in October for Halloween.
50,Harrah's Casino has always been a very nice place for entertainment. It's so many exciting machines to choose from. The staff is also very friendly and always with a smile. It's a pleasure to attend Harrah's Casino New Orleans
50,It was all fantastic! We love Harrah’s the room was super and easy to find. The buffet was delicious and the dining staff special. We won lots of money and enjoyed every aspect of our stay. We look forward to many more!
50,"The experience was a great experience. And hope to visit again.I am a person with direct and short response. My experience was very comfortable, employees were very courteous, professional, very respectable."
50,"We did not have room in New Orleans our. we had room in biloxi, Mississippi. In the future we would like to stay at resort in New Orleans. Our grandson is plays basketball with Tulane. we will be making a lot of trips to New Orleans in the near future."
50,Great casino to visit in the heart of downtown New Orleans. Many slot machnes to chose to play from. Various doors to enter casino so pay attention when leaving casino and notate the correct door. THis casino is tyed to Las Vegas casinos so they did not consider me a new member to receive any perks.
50,Just a beautiful place to be with your friends and loved ones! So many helpful staff members and truly incredible food and atmosphere! Great place to visit and awesome place for the locals to just get out of reality
50,"Nice clean atmosphere! Steven our waiter made my birthday dinner the absolute best!! He did his job, made us comfortable with our food choices. I tried lamb chops for the first time ever and they were delicious! He let me choose my own birthday dessert and it wasn’t small!! Lol was enough for my mother, cousin and myself to eat off of!! Absolutely the best!! U rock Steven!!"
50,They treat you good if you have loyalty. Valet parking for free if you have diamond or platinum status. Parking in New Orleans is the most expensive in the country. We love the perks this casino offers.
10,"I was accosted and robbed in the hallway by my room. I called security and police, both got there at same time 30 minutes later. I was informed by security that there are no cameras in their hotel halls. To add further insult no action was taken by security, local police or state police. I will never go back and warn everyone that the staff are totally indifferent and even rude. Beware and stay at your own risk."
50,Stayed at Harrahs in New Orleans for 2nd time in last three years. Was just as happy the second time as the first. The city was quieter because the Tropical Storm had just hit. So that made it even nicer. The hotel staff was very nice. The room was very clean. Very comfortable bed! Bathroom was nice with a very nice sized tub. It is really nice having the hotel in a separate building from the noisy casino. I highly recommend this hotel to people looking for places to stay in New Orleans!
40,"We did like the no-smoking policy inside the casino. While gaming, we did not like having to pay $2 and $3 for beer (plus we always tip $1 per drink), which is unlike almost all other casinos we have visited. Hotel rooms, casino, & restaurants were clean & nice. Desk staff at hotel, player services staff, & all casino floor staff were helpful & courteous."
20,"I have gambled and stayed at many casino hotels in different cities, and this was by far the worst experience yet. I've never received this level of poor customer service. So many attitudes, lack of help, and total lack of transparency on the hold needed at check in. Everyone was clueless. There were a few people that gave warm greetings but the majority were rude. I've never stayed at a hotel where the parking wasn't free for guests. The associate told us it ""wasnt her problem"" that we had to play for 30min to get validated parking. The rooms were okay. Casino waitresses were fast. Overall poor experience, would not recommend unless there's no where else to stay. Definitely very low on my list of casino hotels that I've visited and would visit again."
40,Very good experience as always. I would definitely go back. The place is well lit and very clean. Staff are polite and very helpful. And the food is always good. A great place to gather and play with friends and family.
50,"Beautiful hotel! Love how good it smells when you walk into the lobby...so fresh and clean. Super nice staff at check in. Beautiful, large, clean room overlooking the river. Comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with a shower and a soaking tub. Everything on every floor is so clean and welcoming. Convenient location within walking distance of the Riverwalk Mall and a great walk on the river front to the French Qtr. Parking is available in the casino garage and valet."
50,"Had a great 4 day trip t NOLA. Hotel was great, room was beautiful. Too bad it did rain in the AM. . The casino was so big and did win and lose but had fun. We had a great meal at the Steakhouse.. and the trip was wonderful. Will be back again soon!!"
30,Average. The rooms need steam cleaned - stains on the carpets and furniture. In one of the bathrooms the toilet was loose. We reserved 2 rooms and both were of similar quality. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly. The parking garage/casino offer “free parking with 30 minutes of play” however we played for over an hour and only earned 16 minutes. I would recommend staying at a different hotel.
40,Very convenient location for fun. There is a wide variety of games. There is an outdoor court for smoking. They have all the new games and a lot of the old games. There are several good food outlets. Overall not a bad experience.
50,Great property. Updated games and table games. Ate atthe noodle bar and the food was fantastic. New ORLEANS has cleaned up its act and we enjoyed walking the French Quarter and other spots. Had a excellent diner at Fins Restaurant would recommend highly.
50,Had a great time while I was There The bathrooms were clean the place was all nice the people were nice had a great time talking with the card dealers Walked out winning a few $100 It turn out to be a great night
50,"Everything was great, can't wait to go back, the casino is in walking distance to everything.the rooms are quite spacious and clean and the people were very pleasant. We were always greeted as we were coming and going they made you feel welcome, this was at the hotel and on the casino floor as well."
50,"Amazing place with a big diversity of slot machines and tables. If you get bored of those you can always play in the poker room some hold'em. Everything is walking distance, French quarter, bourbon street, cruise terminal. Good place to relax!"
50,One of the few casinos that is smoke free. This is super and they all should be this way. Lots of different games and machines to play. Lots of eating places. Great employees. Easy parking and you only have to play 30 minutes a day for it to be free.
30,"This is one of the nicest Harrah's properties I've ever been to, and the decoration, lobby and entryway feel are nicer than most other Harrah's properties. The room itself was spacious, well laid off, and upscale with a large bathroom and separate shower/toilet areas. While the property & rooms are beautiful and conveniently located next to the Harrah's casino, I experienced the following issues during my stay: 1.) Toilet seat in the bathroom was broken and falling off. 2.) Television remote batteries were almost dead, and remote barely worked unless you were within 5 feet of the television. (I reported these issues 3 days in a row, and every day I was told they would be fixed by a member of the facilities team, and they were not fixed until the 3rd day that I again requested…"
50,The casino was fabulous and I had a great experience with the slot machines. I would recommend this casino to anyone. I won a jackpot on a penny slot machine and won $50 and $100 several times during a three day period.
50,Harrah's in New Orleans is a great casino with a non-smoking environment. I love the variety of slot machines. Casino Host greeted me by name and inquired of my experience and wanted to make sure my visit was a good one.
50,"Great stay at Harrah’s, don’t remember room number but rooms were clean and smelled clean!! Would highly recommend staying here to anyone interested in a great New Orleans atmosphere. Treat yourself to a great time..."
50,Loved the location walking distance to bourbon. Great food all around us. Bowling alley for the kids. Adults had fun kids had fun all in all great trip. We will be back in couple of months when it cools off
50,Centrally located to all things that are New Orleans!!! Fun casino with great personnel. Bar drinks a good and easy to acquire. Great atmosphere. Plenty of eating places in the casino to give everyone a good chose regardless of your taste buds.
40,Wonderful hotel and casino property. Right next to the action but far enough away for quiet time. This property is only a couple of blocks away from Bourbon street and is near the Riverwalk. Convenient and exceptional service!
50,"This has been by far the best casino experience-ever! Period!!! I will recommend to my friends and family. I will be returning in the future!!! Although I will pass at least 10 casinos to get to Harrahs, it is worth the trip"
50,Room was very clean and fresh smelling. Service was excellent! Front office is always very helpful. Hotel is located near great food and fun. Casino is just across the street and provides fr a smoke free environment.
50,"Great location - so much to do so little time. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The Saturday and Sunday brunch is well worth the time investment. You won't go away hungry. They have a mini Mardi Gras parade with a jazz band in the casino which was fun. Staff passed out handkerchiefs to guests to wave and participate in the parade."
40,The casino was easy to get to but the parking is horrible. But the experience once we got inside was great. The casino was clean and smoke free for those people who doesn't smoke. There was area pleasing to us smokers and I liked the slots that were available to use had fun and will visit again
50,The whole casino is non-smoking but they do have a outside court yard for smokers. Best of both worlds! The hotel is actually in a different building which kids can go in. They can not go anywhere in the casino building. But there is so much fun to do around town.
40,This property offers a great location with very friendly staff. If your looking for access to the Casino and walking distance to multiple food options including a couple of blocks from Bourbon Street. This is the place for you.
50,"Harrahs is awesome!!We would come back again, the staff cleanliness and entire enviroment was greaT. Short walk to the casino, good choices of games, food and it's very spread out so you don't feel crammed."
40,Harrahs is a good casino but New Orleans is not a place for someone who isnt a big drinker. And the place stinks so bad it is hard to have an appetite. The food was not all that people make it out to be especially if you are a good cook yourself. I can now say been there done that and that was the best part of the trip.
50,Beautiful room just very slow housekeeping. Had to wait until after 6:PM to get in our room. Everyday cleaning was after 4:PM so I really think they need to address the housekeeping service. We never saw the housekeeping crew so could not ask to get our room cleaned. Room not cleaned but no one in the hall or in view to ask.
50,My experience here last week was great we didn’t win much money but everyone was really nice and helpful I would recommend if your area in New Orleans stop in. If don’t know how to play a certain game just ask they will help
50,"had great experience clean, friendly willing to help at all times will be back, did not win any money but I still had a great time, New Orleans id what's up, need more old machines for older people, stayed at Labelle Maison, taxi service excellent"

50,"Awesome rooms/suites and quality service! Will definitely be back soon! Loved the convenience of the location to everything, and we got pretty lucky on the video poker. The buffet was alright, but could be better."
50,Great Casino in the heart of New Orleans French Quarter with exception staff; immaculate facilities and gaming galore...!! The food was also good and the drinks just kept on coming. I also caught a couple of parades passing right in front of the Casino
30,The room that we stayed in had an old very worn mattress. I know this because we had to change our sheets because Housekeeping had left for the day. The edges of the mattress were stiff and very uncomfortable.
30,"The hotel is beautiful but very disappointing that we had NO HOT WATER in the shower for 2 days, we told them of the problem but never got fixed. The food was ok for room service but Other than these problems this hotel is beautiful staff is very friendly and it smells amazing. I would love to go back hopefully it's better next time."
50,Great place to mingle gamble and great entertainment. Smoke free and great New Orleans food. The customer service is great and never a dull moment. Also a great location in the middle of everything you want and need. The hotel is beautiful and great customer service and the staff is very knowledgeable of events
50,Great hotel to stay at. Beds are amazing. The staff was very friendly. Easy access to wherever you need to go. The only complaint I had was in the casino needs more regular $1.00 games. High roller area was really good to me.
50,"Located just near the Casino, the hotel is clean and provides u great hospitality. The hotel workers were very helpful and will guide u throughout your stay. The staffs were very helpful. The restaurants in the hotel was great. When I say food was great(I mean it :))Overall experience was awesome. I'll recommend this hotel to every couple and families:). You wont regret it."
50,PFrom the room to the Hotel staff everything was 5 star .We have already booked our next stay back at harrahs and was very easy to do on the harrahs web sire .The hotel was also in a perfect location and close to everything
50,"The Harrah's hotel has to be the most convenient one in New Orleans. Close to everything in the city and just across the street from Harrah's Casino. There is a tunnel that connects the hotel, parking garage and the casino. So nice when it is rainy or bad weather. The rooms are very nice and the service is excellent. Everyone greets you with a smile! My wife, mother in law and I had a great time."
50,Fantastic customer service!!!! My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Harrahs. The room was large and clean. The location cannot be beat as the hotel is within walking distance of everything that we wanted to do.
50,The room was clean and spacious. On the 21 st floor you can see a wide area of NEW ORLEANS.. There was a small refrigerator and television. Also plenty of towels. The location of the room was quieted.
50,"Everythng was wonderful, convenient,& super fun. Prices were great also. My family & I are already planning our next trip. All six of us had a blast. Everyone was so nice and eager to give you advice to make your trip more enjoyable & fun. Great food."
50,"The Harrah's New Orleans staff members are all very nice and friendly. The bellmen, hosts, and other staff do a fantastic job of making you feel welcomed and appreciated. First Class Service!! Also, the rooms are very nice, clean and big."
50,My trip to New Orleans was fantastic. Le Meridien was a very warm welcoming place to stay. Our location was perfect because it was in the center of the city. Close to entertainment and shopping. The trip was wonderful
40,Great time! Won a little! Great experience and food! Forcing me to make a comment of 200 characters is a bit much! Not sure why they do this as anyone that had a good time can express their emotion in far fewer words then 200 characters!
50,"This casino is one of my favorites! The casino floor is always clean, bright, and they play great music. Lots of slots and table games to choose from, plus great restaurants and bars. I highly recommend the Acme Oyster House for grilled oysters and the Hoodoo bar for cocktails. Everyone, from pit boss’s to floor staff, are so warm and welcoming. They always smile and chat with you as if you were a long lost friend."
40,It is a good mix of players but mainly regulars at the poker tables. The strength of players is decent but sometimes you wonder about the regulars playing together. Many of them switch seats repeatedly within an hours time. Switching seats is legal but it seems that there is a rhyme and reason to their movements.
40,"There was miscommunication regarding our room and no one offer any solutions. What I received from my email confirmation is different from the front desk. Management only can tell us what they don't do and a lot of ""I don't know why it's like that."""
40,Employees there are friendly but best part is hitting a jackpot twice on the same machine and while waiting for the handpay. I played the next machine to it and won . Witnessed a few jackpot winners . Overall good experience
50,The visit was excellent enjoyed myself and the staff was super friendly. I would definitely recommend this establishment to my friends and family. I can't wait for my next vacation and visit. I enjoyed it so much
50,Everything was great my family enjoyed the room and place we visited we will go back there very soon the food was good the hotel was clean I was Amaze I would definitely go back I had a wonderful time
50,"This hotel should be on your list of ""Must Do"" when visiting New Orleans. The hotels location offers great views of the Mississippi river while being in the heart of the action. Traveling to and from the hotel is a breeze as it has it's own stop on the ""Hop on Hop off"" sightseeing bus which is also a ""Must Do"" when visiting New Orleans."
40,"Rooms were very clean and had everything we needed. Location was close to all things one would want to explore. Jackson square , bourbon , French market , Fulton street and plenty of great places to eat are all in walking distance."
50,"The people who works their are nice they keep it clean, they bring out drink real fast and the people who valet parkkng they take your car and bring it back real fast and they show u with respect with a smile"
50,The staff at the property exhibit's excellence in everything they do. I've taken several trip to New Orleans and I always try staying at Harrah's before staying anywhere else. The property location makes everything very accessible.
40,i love the smoke free casino. The hotel is clean and nice too. The lobby is small however. I also love that it's so close to the Cruise port. We have gone to cruise and stayed at the Harrahs hotel. It's very convenient to everywhere.
40,My room was RV with a very comfortable bed. The room was clean. Guest services very professional and greeted me each day. It rain very hard one day causing streets to flood. There is construction going on around parking garage and convention center. Traffic can be at stand still at times. Otherwise good stay
50,"Harrah's New Orleans is always the best. The entire facility, including casino is non-smoking, which keeps everything smelling fresh & clean. The entire staff is always very friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. They will go out of their way to offer the best service. Rooms very clean & comfortable. I always love staying here & always highly recommend it."
50,"I love visiting New Orleans. The people are nice and the food is excellent. Harrah's is situated in a great location, two blocks from the French Quarter if you like to want to visit City Park, the Superdome, the Garden District or the zoo, it's very close to public transportation stops. As always, the casino is open 24/7, is kept tidy and has clean restrooms. The Hotel is located across the street but the two are connected by an indoor tunnel if you want to stay out of the rain. The Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Mistakes can happen but I've never had any trouble having those mistakes corrected. While I don't think there ia a spa in the hotel, there is a chair massage facility in the tunnel as well places to get an inexpensive table massage two blocks away on…"
50,Great time. People very friendly. Slots are too tight but otherwise fun trip. Staff was helpful and made stay. Would recommend to anyone and there are plenty of activities to do while staying and staff more than happy to help.
50,Hotel facilities are wonderful and workers there. Customer service at casino needs a little work security and bartenders I would highly recommend the hotel with 24 hr room service and rooms are really very nice
40,"Nice hotel , service was awesome, employees were super, drinks were flowing, guest were friendly, food was delicious, music was pleasant, valet was quick,dealers were helpful, cocktail waitresses were coming around often,I lost a lot but I did enjoy myself"
40,"Hotel great however I had to stay in a handicapped room because they booked our room due to our arrival time. It was very clean but the outside noise level was high. I would stay there again, its the only casino in town and close to every where you when need to go."
50,"Great place to stay! We had a wonderful time and definitely will be back soon! The hurricane didn’t even ruin our romantic getaway, and the casino is beautiful. Maybe next time we can will some of our money back!"
50,We always get a nice room with friendly staff. We enjoy spending time playing in the casino and the staff is always super friendly. We also enjoy the shops and the buffet. There are several other restaurants in the casino as well so there are several options for convenience!
50,"Rooms are stocked with all you will need for a fabulous stay. Beds are very comfortable, and rooms are with ample space, quiet, and great views of the city or the river. Enjoy the comfort and luxury of a first class hotel!"
50,"I only visited the casino. I had to get a new card and the person was very helpful. Even though I have been a member for years, I was not in the system He tried various methods of pulling up my account. I had my account number in my phone and he was able to compete our transaction. He was very professional and concerned"
50,"Beautiful, clean, tastefully decorated rooms. The staf were professional, accommodating, courteous and friendly. The location was excellent. - close to French Quarters, Riverwalk, and Convention Center."
40,Enjoyed an afternoon in Harrah's while awaiting the arrival of Barry. Barry was a no show!! Had a good time with friends. The property was open and staffed despite the threat of a hurricane. My only complaint would be that our calls for beverage service went unanswered
50,Very beautiful casino and the buffet was ti die for good food and fresh customer service was awesome can't wait to go again. And I also won 300 dollars while I was there very awesome as well. Drinks was good to
50,"Beautiful upscale, clean, neat rooms. Wonderful views of the city and river! Very nice, very comfortable stay with lots of ammenities in house and within walking distance. Only place to stay in NOLA!!"
50,"from the moment you walked in to the hotel until the time we left the customer service was superior. The bellman, the check in experience even when we requested extra blanket and pillows, this whole experience was great. We will definitely be going back. Rooms were spacious and extremely comfortable. You must experience this for yourself."
50,"Stayed two separete times during our visit to NOLA. The rooms are very nice, comfortable and very upscale. Bed was comfortable, all amenities were extremely nice and upscale. This is one of the best hotels that I have visited."
50,The room was very spacious and the view of the Mississippi River was spectacular. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Great experience will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family.

50,"This is my first visit to New Orleans,we were lucky enough to secure a room at the LA QUINTA downtown, Camp St. Room was absolutely spotlessly CLEAN, hotel Staff was very helpful with information about the area and places to eat, etc. check in was a breeze, all of 5 minutes, the only downfall was parking sucks in New Orleans. !!!!!"
50,"Everything was so nice big bathrooms and spacious rooms. The view was amazing you could see some main attractions and Mississippi river .the convention center was in walking distance and bourbon street as well.the casino was clean and clear of trash. The buffet was very delicious, had a variety of seafood to the cabin food from the city"
50,"We took a trip to New Orleans to go to the Essence Festival and to enjoy the sites of Bourbon Street and the other famous places that they have. To make it short, if you have never went to New Orleans this is a place you will have to travel to. Lots of history and so many things to do."
50,"Rooms with wonderful views of the Mississippi river. Casino is fantastic, Great restaurants but no beignets. Nice chili dog for a quick snack. Free parking if you gamble for 1/2 hr. With the free parking walk to the French Quarter. About 10 minutes. I try to get there at least twice a year form South Florida."
50,"We LOVE HARRAHS! we go all of the time, it’s got a great selection of games and the dealers st the tables are very personable too. The hotel staff is also very attentive at the desk and often remember our name. I adore the doorman too!"
50,"Great location, it was convenient to everything. The staff was very friendly and professional. I really enjoyed the overall experience at this location. I will be returning soon. Nice place for couples or girls trip. Lol"
50,"My Sorority Sisters and I recently had a short stay because of Hurricane Barry at Harrah's. I go to New Orleans at least once a year and I have to say this was the nicest hotel I have stayed in thus far. The hotel smelled amazing, the staff was very courteous and the room and bathroom were spacious especially for New Orleans standards. The hotel is very close to the convention center as well as anything you want to go to in the French Quarter and added bonus the casino is right across the street and you can get to it with outgoing outside. I highly recommend and wish we could have stay longer but the staff was very helpful when we had to check out 2 days early because our convention ended and the threat of the hurricane. If you have the opportunity, stay at Harrah's."
50,The place put a smile on my face and my soul i must say cant live without it .The food was great .the valet was great .the music was great the tables was great the slots was great .and yes the smell was great
50,Great time. Good winnings. Plenty of slots and new ones. Ate at small restaurant didn’t want the buffet. Thought that was pricy but looked yummy😜. Not too crowded but busy. Drinks were okay. Overall will go there whenever in NOLA!!!

40,"The location of the casino is close to many shopping area . dinning area,and night life.i even walked to the Dom and Riverwalk.Bring a guest at the Harrah hotel casino,places you in the middle of what's happening."
50,our room was clean and we had all the supplies we needed or requested. Everyone was very helpful and professional. All of our needs were meet in a timely fashion. i would definitely stay here again. we were close to all the attractions in the area.
50,I liked that their slots were loose & jackpots were being won all around. The casino is huge & the atmosphere is clean. Courteous & professional employees were ready to assist. Great gaming experience!
50,Room was great. View was awesome. Staff was great. Room service was excellent. It was a busy weekend but the elevator was running on time. Great restaurant next door. Great security. I would definitely recommend this hotel

50,"I love Harrah's New Orleans!! I have stayed their numerous times and the staff is awesome, the casino is great, and the rooms are top notch.

50,"I always enjoy going to Harrahs, nice clean facility! Staff is very friendly! I would recommend the buffett, good food! Will be back hopefully soon! Great place to enjoy some entertainment and lots of fun!"
50,Room was beyond my expectations and if at all possible I would enjoy the same treatment every chance I can. The staff was very professional and knowledgeable of the city and I enjoy the fact that the hotel is next to the casino.
50,"We didn't stay in a room this visit but we did visit the buffet. We're local so we see the same staff when we visit every couple of weeks. The buffet staff is great! We feel like family when we're there. Elonda, Carolyn, Alisson, Laura and Dora are out usual ""gotta stop and get a hug"" group. Also, my host Terrence, is a sweetie! Very attentive!!!"
50,Everything was great and we definitely enjoyed ourselves. New Orleans is also a great place to visit as well as the casino. There’s so much you can do and the buffet was also great. Can’t wait to go back !!!

50,Didn’t stay at the hotel. I only went to the casino and gambled. It was nice clean and the staff was exceptionally friendly. The drinks was not to well and the service of the drinks was a bit slow also.
50,"Very fun environment for gaming. I actually won in slots. Lots of different games, clean casino and no smoking. You can find most of the latest slots. Free drinks and parking are included, staff are really nice and friendly."
50,Their bones are very beautiful and very clean you will love it The staff there was very nice the food inside of hazzard reported ahead so amazing We had a lot of rain in New Orleans when we went they were expecting a hurricane but still the staff inside of Paris casino made us feel very happy and safe and secure
20,"Hotel is deteriorating quickly. Had king room, high floor. First room a/c was not working. Called down for maintenance and no one came. Went to front desk and changed rooms. As room was changed, maintenance came. Second room was not cold. Carpeting warn in high traveled areas of room, mildew in grouting of shower. Soft water for showering. Caesars is not maintaining the property. Looks like maintenance is not on scheduled basis, but on request, which is the cheap way to go. Hallways dirty. Elevators dirty. I have been staying at this property since it opened and it is in its worst shape. Sad, as the staff is always so warm and friendly to guests."
40,A nice escape from the heat. We came for the Essence Music Festival and the convention center was only about 4 blocks away. Great place to go if you want a good meal for a good price and free drinks with a chance to win a few bucks.
40,"The room is a little on the small side but clean and well-furnished. They put in mirrors in the bathroom strategically to make it look bigger than it is, which was neat. The employees are big on customer service! I wish I could remember the front desk gentleman that checked us in because he was so nice and had a great smile! We also had two waitstaff that were excellent. Nanette was very attentive and made sure that everything we wanted came out quickly and it all tasted great! I wish I could remember the other waitress' name, but she worked late nights and treated us as if we came in during the dinner time, which is to say with great care and made sure we got our drinks and food promptly, even though it was almost 11pm by the time we were able to eat. The bartender also makes…"
50,I really had a great time at this Casino. The people were helpful and some machines were paying off. I guess it was just my lucky day. I was in New Orleans for six days and went to the Casino five of those six days.
50,"The room was absolutely fabulous. I love the fact that the bathroom was separated with the toilet and the bathtub and the shower it was just gorgeous. More than one person could be in a bathroom at a time which I loved. Housekeeping was very friendly as well even though I did not use them much. I think I was in room 1013, and then a few days later I was in room 911. The only issue I had with room 911 was the sink will stopped up. Other than that the room was fabulous. Derek the front-desk check-in staff was absolutely fabulous, funny and made my day with his wit and unconventional humor."
50,"If I could give 10 Stars I would. Essence and work conference made for a long time away from home, but Harrah New Orleans staff made me feel like part of the family... I will definitely be coming back.."
50,"The Harrah’s hotel and casino in NOLA is both beautiful and fun! The atmosphere is exciting, the jazz band is awesome and the service is excellent!...even for a hometown NOLA girl like me! NRKing, NOLA East"
50,"If you're looking for a great time, with friendly and knowledgeable staff, Visit a Harrah's property. The dealers on the tables, Black Jack & Poker, even took the time to explain the game to a couple of my friends with no experience."
50,"My hotel room was excellent and the view from the hotel was magnificent. I like the location of the hotel I was able to get to the French market in the River Walk very easily . Also, I was able to take the rail cars down Canal street and enjoy the town."
50,"Great customer service, great entertainment, excellent food, excellent parking, and a very clean atmosphere. The rooms are remarkable. The location is great you can walk to the Convention Center, museum, mall, restaurants, and the list goes on and on. I had a wonderful time and I highly recommend the Harrah's New Orleans."
40,"Didn't stay at the hotel. But, the casino was nice. Several machines we had trouble ordering drinks from, but that was minor compared to the temperature on the casino floor. It was freezing! Had to go outside to warm up!"
50,"We live locally. Harrah's is our choice for casino fun in the New Orleans area. We have stayed at the Harrah's hotel in the past and it is excellent. Right across the street from the Casino. Should the hotel be booked, there are plenty of ""sister"" hotel that Harrah's uses to accommodate it's guests."
50,My room was centrally located with a AWESOME view. Me and my friends were well stocked with towels and amenities. Tye bellman were excellent and had our luggage available at check in.Loved the easy access to the casino.
50,Even in the wake of a Tropical Storm their hospitality is unmatched. I love that I don't have to hunt down a waitress. With a click of a button they are there with your request. I look forward to my return.
40,"Rooms are lovely, staff is friendly but if you're a smoker please note it is a no smoking facility. It is convenient to all New Orleans nightlife. Also uber to and from areas outside of casino is reasonable. Very clean. Lively atmosphere and masquerade club is jumping on weekend if you're to dance."
40,"My stay at Harrah's New Orleans was to be 5 nights. Because of Tropical Storm Barry, it was cut short to just 3 nights. With the storm threatening, there was a note slipped under the door that the hotel was short-staffed because of Barry and many services such as room cleaning wouldn't be available. Still, the hotel public areas were clean and inviting. Despite the staffing issues and the threatening tropical storm, the hotel continued to operate normally as well as the casino. I'm happy to return for another stay."
50,The room have lots of space to move around. The Elevates move really fast was on 24 floor. Have no problem with the Elevates. Harrah's casino was nice in side an the food at the buffet have a lot of Selection to eat from.
50,"Great food, great drinks, great experience. Can't wait to come back. We visited during one of the most busiest times of the year, Essence Festival and there were still plenty of machines to play. The servers were nice and fast. Everyone great you as you past by. I do not get a chance to come that often, however, it is always a great experience when I do."
50,Beautiful room with comfortable bedding and awesome bathroom. The staff is polite and the entire experience was amazing. I will definitely be back for my future trips to the area and the service will undoubtedly be the same.
50,One of the best casinos I been too great hospitality the people or real nice and fair the food was excellent service was fast and on time I will stay there anytime. I recommend Harrah’s New Orleans to any one out there that’s in for laid back comfortable gambling
50,Very nice and clean and very professional very polite and professional we would luv to have fun with the people of harrah's casino anytime we come to new Orleans this is a very clean and fun place to stay
40,Casino was fun! Great location to our hotel. Did not smell of smoke like most casinos. Waitress service at the machines was pretty quick even though the place was extremely crowded. Will visit again next time I'm in New Orleans.
50,"Beautiful hotel, very clean. friendly staff, always very helpful no matter what your needs. Got stuck here during hurricane and hotel was very accommodating. Would definitely stay here again when I come back to New Orleans"
30,"I had a good time in NOLA (Mainly due to the Essence Festival). The room was nice and I got a city view instead of the river view listed on my reservation. I went on my 7 star trip but it definitely did not compare to my prior Vegas 7 star trips. They wouldn't let my travel companions check in before me while I was still in flight. What a pain to deal with. The host was gone, I communicated with a computer generated ""Host"". I also had to request extra towels everyday when they know how many people were in the room. I was charged extra fees at the casino to take money out of my card which other Harrah's don't charge 7 stars. Definitely not constant with Vegas, Cherokee, or even Atlantic City"
50,"The location is wonderful. The Casino is close to shopping, and restaurants. It is also walking distance to the Cathedral. It was a great time.We had a wonderful experience there. I will be referring coworkers and friends."
50,I normally visit NOLA for work. Harrah's has a great poker room with visitor friendly service. Parking is free if you play for at least 30 mins on any game which is an added bonus. Definitely worth checking out.
50,Great place to place food is good. Staff was nice and accommodatinh when I need help with my players card. Short wait for drinks there are plenty of tables slots and games for everyone's desire's....play for 30 min and get free parking
50,The casino is very attractive and friendly. Very accessible within the city. Table limits are very reasonable. I’ve gambled there before and have no problem recommending Harrah’s to any of my friends or family.
50,Nice and clean very helpful very good people nice people. Expect to visit them again that a good location. Very good food people services will recommend others to come therevin the future to join keep machines cleans
50,My daughter and I was on a short vacation to Gulfport MS so we rented a car and drove into New Orleans for the day. I've been there before but she had not. We were playing tourists so wanted to see some of the sights. Unfortunately we did not get to see as much as we wanted. Will make another trip.
50,"Harrahs rooms are very spacious, customer service is good, having ACME bar and grill located in Harrah's is such a perk. Very good atmosphere. Front desk has great customer service, we were welcomed with complimentary bottles of water. Harrahs is located in a very central area, its walking distance from a lot of the main attractions"
50,excellent property. location in the city is amazing. staff is over the top!!! Must stay at this Location. Everyone young and old will enjoy this trip to New Orleans with Harrahs as the resting place Great Job Staff !!!
40,"We had some comp rooms, and we had never stayed here...so we decided to give it a try. I was beyond surprised at the room...it was a very nice size. Bed was SUPER comfortable. It's a little further away from the French Quarter, but we didn't mind the walking. Definitely would come back. Special shout out to James @ the Front Desk...he mentioned on check in our room wasn't ready...but within minutes he found us a room and we were good to go!"
50,"Room was Very clean, and service to room was also excellent. Everyone on the staff was very professional and polite!! Will definitely come back and visit hotel again! Location was also very convenient to a lot of restaurants and special events!! Like I said very nice location to also shop at the Riverside shops!"
50,"The hotel was nice and clean. The staff were awesome, helpful, and friendly. Valet service was a bit busy but decent. Rooms were clean and spacious. Room Service and food was great!!!! Overall I had a great stay and would definitely be visiting this hotel again!"
50,Played slots and the different areas to play in make it fun and an experience unlike any other. Would definitely recommend harrahs to anyone and everyone i know! Anyone should check out the gaming area give it a shot!
50,"I was traveling during a busy time in the parish. I was very worried that the hotel hallways would be loud and noisy. I am grateful that, that was not the case. Thank goodness. It is a beautiful hotel and the rooms were spacious. I would definitely room her again when returning to New Orleans. The cable TV channel options were lacking but luckily I did not spend much time in the hotel room."
50,The room was spotless with fresh linen overlooking the beautiful Mississippi River. I requested a river view and it looked amazing sunrise and sundown. The separate tub and shower allowed us to relax and freshen up on our time. No rush. The king size bed is comfortable and enjoyable. We enjoyed our stay and the quick hop over to the casino allowed us to change the scenery to the shopping New Orlens nightlife.
50,The hotel room was very clean mattress was awesome I slept well concierge was very helpful I felt right at home view from our room spectacular would definitely stay here again in the future love the casino
20,"There was an upgrade to a very nice suite overlooking the river. We paid dearly for this. Negligible comps. Location is good. That's all. This review must be at least 200 characters. If you want more said, give me more to make it worth my time."
50,I had a great time. It was my first time in New Orleans for Essence Fest and the casino just completed the experience. I would definitely recommend the hotel and the casino to friends and family. I definitely look forward to my next visit.
50,I had the best vacation at this place. The staff was very helpful. I enjoyed myself a lot. I actually left the state to visit another state and I came back to Louisiana and stayed a few more days cause I really enjoyed myself. Thank you for the experience!
50,Out of all the Harrahs properties I've stayed at I found Harrahs NO to be extremely friendly and the room was superb. I would highly recommend this hotel. All of the staff was so willing to help with all my questions
50,Harrahs New Orleans is a great casino. Poker room is top notch. Casino is large. Waitress’s are plentiful and on top of things. Can’t wait to go back. Harrah's casino’s are some of the best in the business
50,Had a great stay at Harrahs. Staff at the front desk was welcoming from the moment we first stepped in the lobby. VIP services was extremely helpful and the concierge helped with our tours. Greeted us when we were walking out of the building and greeted us when we were walking back into the building. A very friendly environment...
50,"Harrah's in NOLA is a great place to stay. The rooms are nice and spacious. The Casino is close by, and there are a variety of places to eat inside of the Casino and around Fulton Street. The staff was friendly and very helpful in arranging tours and providing additional helpful information. 1"
50,"Very clean. Staff was very helpful and friendly. My wife and I had a great time and almost won some money. lol We loved the amount of different machines that they have, especially the Blake Shelton slot."
50,My friend and I arrived late in NOLA and our original hotel gave our room away so we searched for a hotel that wouldn't charge us for 2 nights since we arrived after midnight and harrah's was the only hotel that didn't. They were pleasant and not rude like a lot of customer service ppl I endured in my travels.
50,We always have a fantastic time at Harrah’s in NOLA. It is within walking distance of everything and everyone is extremely friendly! I enjoy going to the casino so it is great to be able to walk to it through the tunnel when it is late or raining. I go 2-3 times a year and enjoy it every time!
50,"Beautiful room, beautiful view. Location is perfect...able to explore the french quarter without needing transportation. The casino was accessible from the the hotel, so no need to leave the A/C when you wanted to gamble."
50,"The casino is non-smoking,but provides smoking outside with games. plenty of gaming options and staff is friendly. The cashier cages are properly marked and easy to find. The cashiers are very friendly. The drink stands are easy to find and again staff is friendly."
50,Very close to our room. Enjoyed walking to and from the casino. The casino and area was very clean friendly and a lot of fun. I would definitely go back and tell my friends to visit if they are ever in the area.
50,"Great Location very accessible, food was excellent, staff very friendly. I dont like the fact that they require me to leave a 200 character review, now i'm wasting my time, please review your guidelines and adjust them!!!!So how happy does that make you."
30,"The toilet was not set correctly in a suite on the 20th floor. The buffet in the casino had gnats flying around. I thought it was an upscale place and it's not, even the main bbn lobby bathroom seemed un attended.The employees however were amazing."
50,"We enjoyed everything from the people to the games. We arrived from Alabama on a day bus trip with a group. We had the opportunity to gamble, shop and eat and enjoyed it all. The dealers were the friendliest of all. Not as uptight as some are at other casinos."
50,"New Orleans location in very clean, comfortable and best of all nonsmoking. Take advantage of the free inside parking with only 30 mins of play time. Great option to escape the New Orleans heat on a hot summer day."
40,"I love a clean and smoke free casino! Unfortunately, bottle service extremely slow. Most customer service was very friendly. Had most slot and table games you would want. Great location near the heart of New Orleans"
40,"The buffet is great, you have to try it! The casino is smoke free so easy to breathe. All staff was friendly. The location is right at the corner of the French quarter so location is easy to get to. Will stay here again."
50,I visited this casino in June. It was hot outside but nice and cool inside. This property is also non-smoking which I also enjoyed. I was in New Orleans for a convention and spent my last day in the casino. There is a wide variety of Slot machines which treated me good on this visit.
50,I loved being able go into the casino and have some fun and relax after all the sights. It was a great way to cool down. Harrah’s had all of my favorite slots and then some. They even had a Starbucks which always makes me smile
50,"I stopped by Harrah’s as part of a family vacation. Didn’t know what to expect, but had a great time and learned 3 card poker. Had the buffet twice. Food was good. The employees were all very personable and helpful. I appreciated the staff’s patience and willingness to instruct in areas I wasn’t aware of."
50,"Fantastic trip from start to finish. Great staff, wonderful atmosphere and the best in hospitality. The buffet was great also. We only had breakfast but the other seatings looked good also. Will definitely return soon."
50,"A lot of machines and gaming tables. Noted that minimum bet on roulette was 10, 15 and 25 during the week and only 1 table was 10. On Saturday it changed to 15 and 25 only. It was not crowded during the week but it picked up for Saturday. Got on a table without much trouble during the week but Saturday they were all packed."
50,"It was my first time to the Harrahs in New Orleans and I enjoyed myself. The facitlity was clean, the staff went above and beyond to be helpful. Wendinednat the restaurant where the staff, service and food were fabulous! All in all it was a great time and winning a jackpot didn't hurt either!"
50,Loved staying here because the people are wonderful and close to everything. Staying in New Orleans was great and Harrahs made it better. Walking across to the Casino which was great gave an added pleasure to the trip as being near the Mississippi River. Great view from our rooom.
40,Had a good time. Didn’t win anything. Clean casino. No smoking per city laws which is a plus. The poker options were small. I don’t like that the blackjack is $15 minimum. They should have a $10 option
50,Great visit and staff was excellent. Erica the front desk host providing excellent information and details 2 surrounding areas how to go to spots. Upon arriving at the hotel my luggage was in a layover so I went to the hotel room without my luggage and ID only having the reservation paper and she provided me with room key as well job Erica.
50,"Harrah's hotel room was lovely. The staff was gracious and efficient. The room we had was very spacious, besides having a great shower I could soak in a massive tub. It was all great. If only I could have won more at the casino is would have been too perfect words...HAHA"
40,Nice hotel and casino in great location. Near dining and streetcar. 5-10 minute walk to Jackson Sq. or Burbon Street. Deanie's on Iberville St has great seafood at reasonable prices but expect a wait.
50,"Always enjoy the staff at Harrah’s. Friendly people. Can send you in the right direction for all good food! The Acme in the casino, good stuff. Will be back to visit the Big Easy, again. Zion Williamson!"
50,new upgrade beautiful wish i could win more often fancy an they always give you free buffet i love it thanks harris keep up the good work an fast service of delivery of drinks great games always have a new game when i visit
50,"We love going to Harrah's in New Orleans. The hotel is clean and beautiful, the staff is friendly and very professional. The location is within walking distance to just about everything. Hop on bus comes directly across the street. The casino is clean, NON Smoking (they do have smoking rooms) and machines are new and updated. All staff really make us feel like we are with good friends and we feel at home there."
50,"Wonderful customer service, great location, clean and beautiful hotel! The staff here are excellent and go out of their way to accommodate the guest to make sure they are happy and satisfied. Will definitely be recommending this hotel and casino to all my family and friends."
50,A group of friends got together from 25 years ago as a reunion and had a ball! We were able to enjoy the scenery. Also the seafood buffet hit the spot from a long day of walking through the French Quarters.
40,"the room was nice but the cold water was warm never would get cold only warmer,this was close to all sorts of places to visit.french quarter/market was in walking distance along with bourbon st and the ww2 museum"
50,"Friendly staff, not rude at all, extremely accommodating. Helped me from point a to point z. These guys went above and beyond to make sure that I was taken care of and I am more thankful for that than anything. Messed up on a Bet and they adjusted it for me before I lost a lot of money! Thanks harrahs"
50,"My time spent at Harrah's New Orleans was fantastic! The staff were gracious and helpful, my room was clean and comfortable and the bed was very comfortable. The location was ideal for all of the things I wanted to see and do. The cost to stay for a week was very reasonable in my opinion."
40,Pro: There are several craps table. Dealers/pit boss/cocktail waitress friendly/professional. Con:The odds on the side bet small/tall/all is not the best but not bad. Other casinos offer much better side bet odds
50,"The people are super friendly and they do their best to ensure every customer has a good time. The dealers have to be the best part of the experience. I wish I could remember what the roulette dealer’s name was but he was super friendly, informative, and made it a really good experience"
40,Overall it was Good but the Boo Fries was not Good the Daiquiri were good but high 4 such a small cup!!! the staff was friendly the machines were not PAYING OFF overall we had a nice tyme I just hated Boo Fries were NOT GOOD and I have been bragging on them 4 Years then She finally get Here and WHAT???
50,"The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Staff is friendly and helpful. Close to Jackson Square and the French Quarter. Best room service breakfast I ever had! For business or pleasure, highly recommend."
50,"The staff was so nice and the hotel was awesome. The steak house was nice, but I prefer the old menu and staff. The casino employees are always very friendly and professional. I wish you had a shuttle from Houston ...."
40,"The room was nice; however, it needed a small desk or table. I did enjoy the breakfast buffet . Hop and hop off bus was a bit pricy and it moved a little to fast to see site sthat the tour guide was talking about , it was disappointing."
50,"Pristine, comfortable and in ideal location, personnel are courteous and pleasant to talk to, the only thing that i was not in favor of, is casino rules specially can't handle cards w/ both hand. other wise our experience was greater than good."
40,"room 1321 new orleans harrahs june 19, 2019 was with a group from south florida from ceasars total rewards for a gambling trip. The casino was not kind to us this time. slot machines very tight and not paying at all."
40,"Very clean and the non-smoking made my day. The customer service guy was very helpful and found I had a card from Vagas so it was my old number, but no points. The buffet was good, a nice variety of dishes but over priced!"
40,We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel was almost perfect. This may sound silly but we thought the toilet paper & tissues were very rough on our skin! Even the casino had softer paper. The staff were all very nice and helpful! We do plan on returning and have joked about bringing our own paper products.
50,We had a great stay while there for a conference. The Casino was fun and the casino staff friendly. The location is also good. Close enough to the French Quarter and good restaurants so you dont have long walks. Will definitely stay again when we visit New Orleans.
50,Its in the middle of all the main events in downtown NOLA and walking around asking for help and guidance is so easy. I would love to spend the night over the weekend and experience the Hotel room and night lighting through out.
50,"The trip overall was very nice. The rooms were clean. The service and staff were excellent. They fixed every concern I had. We ate at the Steak House in the casino, the bar, the diamond and seven star lounge, and one of the restaurants between the hotel and casino. All the food was excellent. My only concern which I did not like was I was on my annual seven star retreat. Instead of putting $500 credit into your account they added points to your total rewards balance. They are the only place doing this and I had a hard time being convinced they had added the points to my total rewards. If you had cashed these points out for cash you would only get $250."
50,"I love to visit New Orleans and enjoy the great food and culture . I will stay at Harrah's Hotel and Casino when I go to New Orleans from now on. Location is great , yes, but service it beyond excellent. Famous Mothers Poboy and seafood across the street from Harrah's is a bonus."
50,"Fun and games, just what one would expect at Harrah's.No trouble finding a table with an open chair and the games varied enough that one could always find something to play.The different slots were fun and the amount of payout seemed to be good. Slot play varied from $.01 to $10.00 so it was easy to find any amount to play."
50,We were on the 29th floor overlooking the mighty Mississippi and could watch the cruise ships come in.The Diamond Lounge has great food but no 7 star line to enter.The servers there are very friendly and accommodating. There is no smoking in the Casino but there is a place outside where you can play and smoke.
40,Great casino with plenty of tables slot machine and entertainment. Casino was clear free of smoke and the food was good at all restaurant from simple burger to a sit down restaurant Karaoke bar was a lot of fun. Live entertainment available
50,"Could not have had a better time the several days we were there...great service, wonderful food and friendly people. I plan on making many more trips to Harrah's in New Orleans, Hope to bring other friends with me next time"
50,"Seriously I would like to thank the entire Harrahs staff everyone was very nice and helpful from the casino, the parking, the buffet and Hotel.Me and my family will definitely be returning on our next visit to New Orleans."
50,"Beautiful Hotel, everyone was so nice and friendly. Looking forward to going back soon. Located in the perfect area. Fulton street right outside the door, with a variety of entertainment and restaurants. Smoke free environment and Casino right across the street."
50,very nice room and great food All employees very professional My birthday was never a dull moment The music in the casino and band was so great This was one of the best times of our life Boat ride and French Quarter all special times
50,amenities at the casino were great.the staff was friendly and courtious .the wait staff was prompt. this was a really great experience.i look forward to coming back real soon. every one was so helpful.the bathroom were clean. when a visitor got intoxicated in the rest room the attendent made sure that she was helped to the car.
40,We love New Orleans! The Harrahs Hotel was ok. Had to call at 4:30 to ask if we could get our room cleaned. Everything else was good. Great restaurant ever connected to hotel. Shrimp bisque was unbelievably good. However staff was very slow.
50,Check in process was quick and professional. Great Room overlooking the Mississippi River.Room was modern and extremely comfortable. We had two dining experiences at nearby Harrah's associated restaurants and enjoyed both.

50,great casino with lots of new games and great host. Everyone was so helpful and offered recommendations with out being asked. Had a very fun trip and loved the atmosphere in the place everyone was enjoying the place.
50,"If it is for a long weekend or a few hours in the casino it is always great fun! All employees are engaged and do their best to make you smile and enjoy the time visiting the property.Facility has always appeared maintained well, clean and attentive staff for any requests."
50,"Lots of fun, great food, great ppl.. cant wait to visit AGAIN!!! No complaints!!! My wife and I really enjoyed our bday at Harrahs.. both N.O. and BILOXI locations were GREAT.. we drove to both in one week.."
50,Nice place great casino 🎰. I will go again. Maybe next time I get there I’m going to stay. We tried but everything was taken. This is our 4 time visiting this hotel and always have I nice time. You have to make sure you get the parking ticket 🎫 voucher after playing so you don’t pay parking.
50,"Harrah's Hotel and Casino in New Orleans is in a great location. Walking distance to a lot of things to do. The food is great and so are the people. You are not far from Bourbon Street, the water, jazz, restaurants. The hotel is very nice, but bring warm clothes as they tend to keep it very cold."
50,I always love coming to Harrah's when I visit New Orleans whether I stay there or not. The staff is EXTREMELY friendly and helpful so it's a great atmosphere overall. It's also central to everything fun so it's a great starting point for your day in the Big Easy.
40,"After an afternoon of eating, drinking, and having fun on Bourbon Street...this was a PERFECT way to beat the heat!!! After hours of walking the French Market and carousing the French Quarter, some time in the wonderfully air conditioned casino was just what I needed. :-) Plenty of slots and table action to while away your time and your money!!! LOL Also plenty of food options from a quick sandwich to sit down restaurants."
50,"Great staff, drinks and very friendly vibe and I will be back to visit again. Staff helped with questions and showed me were things were located. Even Help me with drink orders. Keep up the great work"
50,"While we didn't stay at Harrah's, we did have dinner there one evening, and spent time gambling as well. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The casino gaming floor is huge, almost to the point of getting lost. It is in a great location right off of the French Quarter and accessible to many other desired sights. Highly recommend a visit!"
50,"Great room. Great service. Enjoyed the casino games. The poker room's unlimited buy-in for 1-3 poker sucks. Nobody visiting is going to sit down for a buy in of $300 when the house players (every day locals) are buying in for 5,000 or more. Other than that, we love New Orleans and Harrah's."
30,Room was great on 17th floor facing river. Large and up dated. Front desk at hotel was great friendly and great representation of Harrah’s... most other service SUCKED! Must be contact workers not actual.Harrahs employees.
50,"The room was roomy and comfortable. We had a river view that was actually what we asked for in our request. The property itself was very clean and beautiful. Additionally, I can't say enough about the hotel staff. They were exceptional! Give me a reason to return and I will definitely do so... in addition to recommending that everyone stay at Harrah's New Orleans!"
50,"My sisters and friends flew to NOLA from Chicago. The hotel had a limo pick us up. My Host sent a tray with cheese, wine, and New Orleans Favorites. The Hotel was clean and the staff was amazing. the food i=at the buffet was good and I felt safe. The only problem I struggled with was the Eleveators. sometimes the keycard didn't work."
50,The staff were super friendly staff - offering to take you to the restaurant you were looking for or the gaming machine or table that you are seeking. There are a few good restaurants to enjoy so if you are there for a few days you have options. The machines on the floor were fun and easy to find and play. Even Harrah's itself was easy to locate/access.
50,Customer service in the hotel was wonderful including the room service and the maid service however the customer service and the casino rude behavior from employees at the Acme Oyster House... I believe it is very consistent as far as the service given at this particular location poor bad attitude and in general extremely slow service which leaves an overall lasting impression of the experience at the casino thumbs down
50,"Great staff--very helpful.Travelling with some of our adult children--the staff kept us together on the same floor, We also ate at Manning's --very reasonable and good food. The rooms were clean and well stocked--we gambled enough for free parking for two days. We will stay there again."
40,"Don't forget to go to Harrah's even if you don't gamble. It is part of the total NOLA experience! The decor, the buzz, the atmosphere, the location and the people make it a destination. It is conveniently centered in the middle of NOLA!"
50,This hotel was very clean and comfortable. The employees were great ! I was very impressed with the casino and its size. The hotel is located right next to the Mississippi river and the shopping mall located there. Very close to the street car which gives you access to the major areas of the city
20,"My wife and I recently stayed at Harrah's New Orleans. The accommodations and location were fine. Our issue arose when some of my wife's jewelry came up missing immediately after a turn down service. We filed a complaint with the hotel and were informed there would be a thorough investigation. We departed 3 weeks ago and have yet to receive any update from the property. We have called numerous times and we are continually re-directed. We are of course upset by the loss of property, but we are equally unnerved by the inadequate response and the lack of professionalism from the hotel staff. With so many quality hotels in close proximity the casino I see very little reason to ever stay at the Harrah's New Orleans."
50,"We had a great room with a view of the river (beautiful), We ate yummy food at the buffet and Palm Lounge. The staff are friendly, helpful and thoughtful. The gaming was fun with a good assortment of slots and the icing on the cake, it's NOLA!!! What more could you ask for!!!"

50,Only went to casio for 3 hours. Did not stay at there hotel. Had lunch at the casio. We had Nacho's for four people. It was superd. Coun't finsh it. Service was great. Went to the resroom and found them to be very clean and decorated very beautiful.
50,casino is awesome room was very clean staff very friendly NOLA is a great city to visit with lots to do and you definitely can prepare to have an awesome meal if you eat at Ruths Chris you can go wrong the food and staff are top notch
40,harrah's did a good job on the room.Some of the best deserts i have tasted Harrah's has some of the best slots .took a few dollars home. will do this trip again .saw alot of folks with smiles on their faces.
50,"The hotel was amazing and very convenient to everything we wanted to do. Be sure to order the beignets for breakfast!! The non smoking casino was the most enjoyable gambling experience I have had. I wish all casinos were non smoking!! The staff at both the casino and the hotel were awesome, friendly and professional. The only negative is the condition of the ladies restroom in the casino. The toilet stalls and wash basins have a lot of corrosion which makes them look dirty. Time for some renovation. Other than that the property is exceptional!!"
50,"Beautiful hotel lobby. Charming, comfortable and spacious rooms. Excellent customer service! I was greeted with a smile and before I left I was given complimentary bottles of water. Ruth Chris Steakhouse is connected to the lobby. Delicious!"
30,"Not at this time. My problems may have been a one-time thing. I was given a room that wasn't what I expected. The sofa was stained and the curtains didn't close all the way. Because of the money I put in the machines, I should have been given a nicer room."
50,"My family and I love Harrahs New Orleans and it's always a fun experience, since the day it opened! I feel like I'm somewhere new with each visit. It's Never a dull moment when you add fun, food and friends."
50,The casino was gorgeous and had so many fun games to play! It was our first time in NOLA and were pleasantly surprised to have a casino within walking distance of our hotel. We can't wait to plan our next trip to New Orleans to experience more!
40,Hotel casino is right near the French quarter so location is excellent to walk around. Parking is $$$$. Casino is nice and well designed and typical. Everyone seems very helpful and willing to offer help and advise
50,Wonderful trip. Casino is spacious and clean. With a variety of local attractions you have a lot of options to occupy your time. I can’t wait to return to New Orleans Harrahs.... already have another trip planned for late July.
50,"My husband and I regularly fly over to New Orleans, even if just for a day trip, or weekend. The customer service at Harrah’s New Orleans, makes it a “must-visit.” The hotel is gorgeous and clean. The location has perfect walking access to the French Quarter, or the Business District. Staff members are professional, friendly, patient, kind, and genuinely welcoming. Of special note, is the superior customer service provided by Ms. Mariann Remy Germany, who takes the time to literally find you in the casino, and ensure that every travel need is met, and superb, right down to the perfect dining experience. I travel to many different cities, for leisure, throughout the year. Ms. Germany’s attentive service, keeps us returning to Harrah’s New Orleans."
50,"I had fun playing poker, friendly staff & nice environment. I wish they had tournaments and room promotions, but overall i was happy with the visit and I'll be back to play more games. thank you all so mcuh"
50,"Although I didn’t leave with all the money I came with, this place was amazing! The main areas are non-smoking and it just makes the experience that much better! I would recommend stopping by here for a Roll of the dice!"
50,"Got free parking, which was nice, since we stayed at a nearby hotel, the Old No.77. Would have stayed at the Harrah's hotel, but couldn't get a deal. I like the casino and the hotel. The buffet is way too expensive now, but it's nice to have the other choices for food, plus Mother's is on the corner of Poydras and Tchoupitoulas. Yum!!!"
40,"We were in town for a seminar and chose the Harrah's Hotel for our stay. Every single staff member we encountered was friendly. Love the conversation-starter name tags. Check-in was easy. Room was ready, not early, but on time. Housekeeping staff were so friendly and helpful. The room itself was very nice. Large bathroom. Large bedroom. Fridge in the room. A/C worked well. Comfy beds. Clean room and bathroom. Fluffy towels. Only issues were that it is way too dark in the bathroom. The sink knobs are loose and leak water. Low water pressure in the shower. I hate when a hotel falls down on routine repairs like leaky sink faucets. Overall a great stay. We will stay at Harrah's again."
40,Very clean room enjoyed our stay. Good view as well. Played and ate at the casino. Overall a great getaway. I recommend this to be your first choice of accommodations when searching for a premium hotel.
50,"From my room, I had an excellent view of the river. I loved the small couch ...satee(sp?) under the big window. Sitting there, i almost read an entire book. I spent time on the trolley and at the Riverwalk."
50,I love that this casino is non smoking. The dealers were friendly and hospitable. There is a good variety of slots and table games. The restrooms and casino floor were clean. The decor is based on masquerade which is bright and fun.
40,"It really help that I won some money, but the overall experience was good. Servers and dealers were all great minus 1 server. Everything was clean, the staff was friendly and the service was quicker than Vegas"
50,Had an awesome time with some of my buddies on my 21st birthday. I've never been to a casino before so i figured I'd try it out. My friends and I got a few drinks a piece and played a few hundred into the slot machines and we had a blast. 5/5 stars
50,Had a great time at Harare’s in New . Orleans. Will be back to spend more time there great experience . It’s been a while since I been there but everything was great even the buffet. Everything was lovely
40,"The hotel is convenient to the casino, restaurants, transportation and attractions. Our room was on the 20th floor and while clean, could use some improvement/updates. The bathroom had a large shower and full-size tub. The beds were extremely comfortable."
50,We had a great time at Harrah's New Orleans. It's located in a great location in the city so you can hit all the tourist spots. We enjoyed the steakhouse at the casino. People were very nice! The hotel is very nice.
50,"My experience was overall terrific, even though I lost money during my time there but that’s a part of gambling. I had a good time in the buffet area. The food was extremely good and satisfying ! I would expect anyone to go to Harrahs and have s good time!"
50,"Definitely recommend paying a visit to Harrahs casino in New Orleans. Easily accessible and close to French Market, rooms can be a little pricey, but can possibly get rooms comped if have points with their reward system."
50,"We only stopped on our way to the airport. We were coming from Gulport MS, the valet was kind and quick. The casino was clean and full of options. It was nice to charge my phone sitting at a betting table, not while playing of course."
50,Hotel is very nice with kind and helpful people. Casino experience was the same and I thoroughly had a great time. Very accommodating service. I was always greeted. And they had all the games I wanted with a cool night club right in the middle of the casino that is fun as well.
50,"My rooms are always nice and the employees are always pleasant at the hotel. The buffet need to be a little bit more efficient and cleaner. The food is hit or miss, but overall, it's a really nice hotel."
50,"Always love coming to this place. Staff is really nice and accommodating. Love the addition of being able to park in the parking deck for free if you play for 30 minutes. Also, always a good variety of games to play."
50,One of the nicest casinos we have visited. Highly recommend for you to visit while in New Orleans. The employees were very nice and helpful. The general manager was walking around and talking with everyone and greeting them. We had a really nice conversation with him.
10,"Not very accommodating or friendly, would not recommend staying at this property. Do yourself a favor and stay at a better hotel , there are plenty to choose from. The dealers are not very friendly and the hotel staff is not customer service oriented."
40,"Nice experience overall. Hotel does not have a pool, which is sort of disappointing. Property is lovely inside and out. Staff was friendly and housekeeping was very friendly . I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends."
50,"Very friendly, helpful and quick service. Atmosphere was fun and inviting. Food and drink options were plentiful. Staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. I will go there again when I am in town next time."
40,The casino was very clean and the non smoking is much preferred. However in the early afternoon there were no $5 table games. We had to play digital machines instead of real black jack. My son was there for the first time on his 21st birthday and was a little disappointed.
50,"Dropped by the casino to lose a few bucks and had a great experience! Staff was super friendly and helpful. Machines were fun and you ordered drinks right from the slots! Who'd a thunk it and why isn't this in Vegas? Drop by for a great time! Oh, smokers? enjoy you smoking section outside where cool air pours down on you and there are slots available. How fun!"
50,We always stay at Harrahs New Orleans when on the coast. We love it there! Always very excellent food and accommodations. Front Dest service as well as Maid Service always five stars! Never had a bad meal there from the hot dogs to the five star restaurant always excellent. We also love the gaming there. Win or lose we always feel like we won.
20,"Front desk hung up on me, transferred to wrong destination, failed to return my phone call....I am very disappointed in the level of care and service offered. I left a sweater in the hotel room and within minutes realized, in the casino and never got a hold of anyone."
50,This a fun enjoyable casino. Great area of New Orleans with many things to do within a short walking distance. Many great restaurants in the Casino and also within walking distance. The Harrah's Hotel is a very nice place to stay.
50,"Our room had a river view- very entertaining! We especially enjoy a smoke-free casino. The room was great- clean and large. Employees were more than accommodating. Got some good tips on places to eat- the Grand Isle is a favorite of all times. We took a trip on the Santchez, which I would recommend to everyone. Overall, a great trip!"
50,The room was beautiful and very comfortable. Had room service was delish. Love staying at Harrahs Had the buffet large variety of food would recommend had fun with the slots love love the non smoking casino. Wish all Harrahs would go Smoke free
50,Spent one night at Harrah's after staying across the street at the Hilton and it was so much nicer. The staff was very friendly and the room was very clean and very nice. Loved the lighted makeup mirror and huge soaking tub in the bathroom and found the beds to be very comfortable. Was a little disappointed we could not switch rooms (screaming baby in adjoining room) but I understand the hotel was full. All in all really enjoyed the hotel and casino.
50,"Excellent hotel stay with exceptional rooms; great food, location, friendly slot machines and a very hospitable environment. Within walking distance to the infamous French Quarter and Riverwalk. Superb!!"
50,"There is no complaints at all. The Harrah's New Orleans is the best casino in the Southeast. The location, hotel, restaurants and the Casino execeeded all expectations! More important all employees recgnized the importance of the customers. Great Feeling!"
50,"My husband and I enjoyed our time at Harrah’s casino New Orleans. After a long day of seeing the sites in New Orleans it was nice to go to Harrah’s and relax. This non-smoking establishment was a literal breath of fresh air (I believe it is a law in Louisiana). I really liked the ability to order your drinks through your slot machine! The cocktail waitress arrives with your drink within minutes of ordering! Come on Vegas, it’s time to do this too! There is a steakhouse, burger place, Starbucks and buffet to eat. We ate twice at the burger place as it was so good! In the end, we didn’t win but we had a fun time!"
50,This room is very large for the New Orleans area and it has an awesome bath tub that is large enough for two. In New Orleans most hotel rooms are small in comparison and their bathrooms don't measure up to this one. My room had the two queen beds as well as a chaise lounge chair. The entire outside wall was glass overlooking other hotels and the city. The in room coffee maker was on a shelf next to the vanity and easily accessible. The toilet was enclosed in it's own little room. They did have the bottle of water that if you consume it they will charge you $6.00

50,Another trip to NOLA one of my favorite party cities . This was my first stay at a Harrah's property . It didn't disappoint me . My concierge Ivy was stellar . All requests to her were met . Fantastic
50,The casino was well maintained and the people were friendly and hospitable... I was there celebrating my birthday and the marriage of my oldest son I didn't stay at Harrahs hotel because i work for JW Marriott
50,The Hotel is absolutely gorgeous. Close to the French quarter and other sites. The casino is lovely and staff is eager to help. There is shopping across the street from the casino and a street car to take you to the quarter
50,Fast early checkin with no extra fees. Room was perfect. Great view of the river and bridge. Close to everything we enjoy in NOLA. Parking was free since we self parked in the Harrahs garage. Casino was lucky the first night but not the second. Great trip! The food! OMG!...
50,"Great place to stay and gamble, clean environment, no smoking, great food, friendly and nice employees! Harrah's is right in the middle of all the action from the French Quarters, to the French Markets, great restaurants, shopping, and etc.!"
50,"The staff was great and attentive, you can even request a drink from the slot machine. Lots of food choices everything was great. Overall we stopped here on our honeymoon and we were not disappointed."
40,"Quick visit to the casino during my New Orleans trip. Nice friendly atmosphere and I would visit again. I didn't have a room at this hotel, so I can't review that. Central location makes it an easy visit."
50,Las Vegas. Suite at Harrah's. Great service. Great parking service and room service. A lot to do in Vegas. Made it a great trip for my baby and I. Great music and food. I will recommend other to come to Harrah's for a trip.
50,I was amazed at the pleasant atmosphere of every worker I encountered. Absolutely a great staff. These people really seemed to enjoy their jobs. The property was nice. All of my wants and needs were met with a smile of joy. Definitely recommend. I know I'll be visiting again!
40,I arrived late on a Monday night and was ready to enjoy the casino. The employees showed me around and checked on me to make sure I could find everything. I had a great time for the next two days at tables and slots. I will definitely be returning as soon as I can.
50,The rooms are super awesome and extremely clean. The hotel smells wonderful. Had great fun in the casino. The food was great. Myself as well as my family and friends will definitely be returning soon.
50,"I can remember two ladies that took care of me and my friends while we were there was, Lisa the bartender who always greets with a smile and soon as u walk in she making your drink son as she she you and knows your drink and how you want it and another one A Dealer name Kordney, beautiful girl always smiling and very helpful about anything I ask 😀"
50,Good did not win a penny so I was disappointed because it was my birthday. Would like to win sometimes but it never seems to happen for me. But it was still fun to go and play the slots. The casino theme is very New Orleanian.
50,"Beautiful hotel ,great location , and awesome customer service!! Overall great experience !!! I would definitely stay there again upon future trips to New Orleans . It’s right on the edge of the French quarter is he walking distance to the French market in the WW2 museum."
50,I had a suite over looking the River and warehouse district! The Hotel was beautiful and the casino kept me entertained the whole time I was there. The Lucky Dog stand in the casino was tasty and the buffet was delicious.
50,I was killing time and figured I'd come spend a few bucks and ended up having a blast. Won some money as well as had me a few good drinks. Cant complain about being at Harrahs at all. To be honest I never have had an issue at the casino.
50,It was a great trip and even better vacation. The casino was great and the staff was very friendly and pleasant. I will definitely recommend this casino to friends and other family. I can't wait to return for more fun.
40,"Great experience at this resort. All of the employees were tremendous except the front desk staff. They were rude and abrupt. This is the front of the house, first impression for the hotel. A young man was very forceful with the ""no smoking"" policy even though we don't smoke. It was almost accusatory. During other interactions, the front desk employees did not offer to assist us, preferring to talk with their friends until asked by the customer."
50,"Once again, I had an amazing time in New Orleans, all because I always stay at the Harrah's Hotel and Casino. The friendly staff at the hotel and casino make you feel comfortable and relaxed. I travel to New Orleans two to three times a year, all three trips I always stay at Harrah's Hotel and Casino. The first of three visits is focused on kicking off my summer holidays (Memorial Day Weekend). This year's visit for Memorial Day Weekend was amazing and once again, no disappointment! Once again, the staff at both the hotel and the Casino were friendly, very helpful. The food in the restaurants in the casino, hotel, and the surrounding area were great, The fun and atmosphere of being there at the hotel and casino was relaxing, fun, and energizing! In short, spot on for me…"
40,"Fun casino, great Mardi Gras vibe. Poker room had a short wait , with nice dealers and lots of locals. My table 4 player at my table knew each other. I was lucky they were bad players. Tons of crap tables they were always fun, but very fun. I would recommend."
50,"Harrahs is a comfortable, hospitable exhilarating gaming and living experience. The employees are nice and warming and always willing to help. The restaurants have delicious flavor popping food and bars close by with agreeable prices. Can’t wait to come bck 💜"
50,The room was very large with a river view Video poker was good Manning’s sports bar & restaurant was excellent The buffet was very good Customer service was great as always with Harrah’s We will be returning soon
40,"Harrahs is a great place to stay when visiting NOLA. It’s in a good location, making it easy to get to the main attractions around the city, and it’s a clean, comfortable hotel. Its my preferred place to stay when I visit New Orleans, but it is a little pricey, so I don’t get to go too often. Plus, if you’re like me and have a hard time staying away from the casino it could help make or break your trip. Lol"
50,"This was by far the best Casino I have ever been in. I love this place and I will definitely be returning to this Harrah's. Also the drinks were good and stiff,( like I like them). The rooms were very clean. The food amazing."
50,Great room and kept clean by housekeeping. Smoke free casino which is nice. All the staff at the front desk and casino were very friendly and helpful. I look forward to going back in the future. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone.
50,Staying at Harrahs was perfect. My my Husband could go to casino and I could go shopping. I later met up with him. I gambled some and then we ate at Acme located in the casino. It was nice that I felt safe to walk back to hotel on my own.
50,"We enjoyed the harrah casino and the cajun buffet. They give military id card holders discount. You get a free parking ticket if you stay and play for 30 minutes. Otherwise parking will get you. Very very clean and smoke free. Not hot inside so take your sweater . Although we did not win, we played the pennies, we will go back. Now i just next harrah to give me a free night and i will be in cajun heaven. If your there, try it out."
50,This is now my tenth time to harrahs New Orleans and it still is magical. The high energy of everyone from the time you get there until it time to say goodbye never a dull moment the upbeat casino action to the wonderful rooms so nice and clean you don’t want to leave my saying is always the same” as soon as I leave within fifteen minutes I always say when can we come back” never a bad time always so enjoyable and fun
50,"Friendly, welcoming staff. The best location in the city. Step out any door and your in the heart of New Orleans. Amazing food at the Restaurants in Harrah's or within walking distance of many other places to eat/drink. Close to all kinds of shopping and historic places to visit."
50,It was my boyfriends first time and we absolutely loved it. We were greeted and treated like family. I did not have to wait in line to get a new card the lady that works there helped me at the machine to get a new one. It was very fast and extremely pleasant.
50,"Anytime you are going to be in NOLA, I would strongly recommend you stay at the Harrah's hotel and casino. Top notch people, great southern hospitality, great restaurants and a great casino. They will take good care of you!"
50,Stayed at Harrahs several years ago and I was pleasantly surprised at the difference. Super clean and non-smoking!! Love the machines have the beverage button so you are not spending endless time trying to find a drink.
50,Rooms were amazing. Clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Atmosphere was very inviting. Lots of options nearby and within Harrah's so it made it convenient to go do and see a lot of things and not have to go far.
50,The craps table and dealers were excellent and very friendly. Also the free parking and service by waitresses was an exceptional extra. The dance floor and music at night was very exciting. I enjoyed the food and drinks.
40,the people in the casino are always nice and friendly and the slot machines are fun to play they have the latest machines out to play and there is always one or two available to play or you can go to the buffet and get some food or stop by one of the sandwich shops in the casino
50,"Everything you need or want is in one place. Enjoyed Mannings restuarant. The bar tenders, two ladies, were very nice and made great tasting bloody Mary's. Harrah's casino, the tenders were prompt. No lines, cash machines/exchanges are conveniently available."
50,"I enjoy Harare’s every time I visit. They are friendly and have wonderful relationships with their customers. I think that if you are planning a trip to New Orleans, La, then you must visit Harrah Casino!!"
50,I had a great experience. Rooms are very clean. Prompt service. I have never came in contact with a rude employee hear. They are eager to answer you questions. They also give great recommendations for dining and sightseeing.
50,The entire operation at Nola Harrah's is first rate. The hotel is well managed; the staff is extremely cordial and helpful and the rooms are clean. The casino is very well; and there are amble staff to assist you. The buffet is very good. We will return
40,"The hotel is located directly across the street from the casino. It is also proximate to the French Quarter, shopping and has easy access to other NOLA venues. While I generally choose to eat at a variety of nearby dining establishments either just inside or just outside the Quarter, I did have a great meal at the casino's Steak House. Service was excellent and the food was exceptional"
50,The room was in a great location with a great view. Very nice and spacious. The only recommendation would be to add additional pillows in the closet. Better loading and unloading area. Very tight area that made you feel very rushed.
50,"Paul and his staff in the Casino Diamond Lounge, especially, Kayla, Danielle, Tiara, Christal, Cosette, Paris, Pedro, and Dana provided outstanding service each and every time we visited. Thanks also to the bartenders. I also would like to recognize Kenneth, Bellman and the other bellman. The bellman very often the first contact that folks have with Harrah's and they make a great first impression. Mark and the other concierges are able to handle a wide variety of persons and situations with a great deal of professionalism and knowledge and are personable so that every one has their undivided attention. They are great! The same compliments apply to Johnna S. and the other persons at the front desk. Brittany, Kawana in the Buffet were very helpful in having us enjoy our time…"
50,I was looking to cross off New Orleans off my Bucket list for my 50 th Birthday. Harrah s was a beautiful and fun place to stay!!! New Orleans is a fun and amazing place from the food to the party to the history. Everyone should go there at least once in there life time!!!
50,"Room, very nice. Food very good. Good selection of restaurants. Good selection of video poker which played quite well. Did not care for the underground tunnel from hotel to casino, but I reckon there is no other choice."
50,"We stayed at Harrahs, I love the location kinda away from Bourbon Street but not a far walk. The room was beautiful and the staff was amazing. From room service to guest check in. Love it here. Also if you like to be in between Bourbon and the Superdome this is a good choice. Kind get the best of both!!"
